Unix compilation instructions
-----------------------------

For unix users, the compilation process should resume to:

$ ./configure
$ make

(as root)
# make install

The installation script takes care of putting the built module in the apache module directory.
The process for activating a module is usually distro specific, but can be resumed by the 
following snippet that should be present in the apache configuration file(s):

LoadModule geocache_module    modules/mod_geocache.so
<IfModule geocache_module>
    <Location /geocache>
        SetHandler geocache
        GeoCacheConfigFile "/path/to/geocache.xml"
    </Location>
</IfModule>

(as root)
# apachectl restart


Customizing the build, or if something went wrong
-------------------------------------------------

mod-geocache requires apache, liburl, and libpng development headers.
The configure script will try to locate them in default system locations, that can be
overriden or specified with switches (./configure --help should give you a full list):

apache apxs
===========

--with-apxs=/path/to/apxs

apxs is the apache extension tool that is used for building and installing the module to a local
apache instance. it should be installed along with a standard apache build, or supplied by
distros when installing the apache development packages.

libcurl
=======

--with-curl-config=/path/to/curl-config

libpng
======

--with-png=/path/to/png/prefix

this is the path where the libpng headers and libs can be located.
the configure script will be looking for [path]/include/png.h and [path]/lib/libpng.so
