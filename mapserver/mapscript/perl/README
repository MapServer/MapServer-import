To build type:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make install

Presently everything is set for a default install with FreeType, GD 1.2,
TIFF and EPPL7 support. Edit Makefile.PL to change the defaults. This will
eventually be *much* cleaner.

If the mapscript_wrap.c file does not exist, copy the mapscript.i file
into this directory and run 'swig -shadow -perl5 mapscript.i'. If you do
not have swig, be sure to install the SWIG Version 1.1 (Build 883) not the
1.3.x development release.
