Java mapscript
==============

Before you begin, the JAVA_HOME environment variable must be properly set
and the Java programs "java" and "javac" must be on your path.

SWIG wrappers
-------------

MapServer releases, beginning with 4.2.4, contain pre-generated wrapper code
(mapscript/java/mapscript_wrap.c) and class files (mapscript/java/edu).  You
may generate your own using the "interface" target in the Java Makefile.

Installation
------------

After MapServer is configured and compiled, change directory to the Java
mapscript location and execute::

    $ cd mapscript/java
    $ make
    $ make test

Copy the shared libmapscript and mapscript.jar to the appropriate location.

Windows
-------

Edit makefile.vc to match your environment.  You will need to set JAVA_HOME 
and SWIG_HOME to the appropriate variables.  You will likely need to copy 
all of the DLLs needed to run MapServer into the mapscript/java directory 
(including libmap.dll) so the mapscript.dll can see them to run.

cd mapscript/java
nmake /f makefile.vc
nmake /f makefile.vc test
