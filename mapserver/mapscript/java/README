Java mapscript
==============

Before you begin, the JAVA_HOME environment variable must be properly set
and the Java programs "java" and "javac" must be on your path.

SWIG wrappers
-------------

MapServer releases, beginning with 4.2.4, contain pre-generated wrapper code
(mapscript/java/mapscript_wrap.c) and class files (mapscript/java/edu).  You
may generate your own using the "interface" target in the Java Makefile.

Installation
------------

After MapServer is configured and compiled, change directory to the Java
mapscript location and execute::

    $ cd mapscript/java
    $ make
    $ make test

Copy the shared libmapscript and mapscript.jar to the appropriate location.

Windows
-------

If any user has a robust win32 Makefile or build script to contribute to the
MapServer project, we would be delighted to incorporate it.
