PYTHON 2.0 OR NEWER

Should be easy.

The setup.py script requires Python 2.0 or newer.  Apologies to the
die-hard 1.5.2 folks.  This hopefully won't impact too many people since
distutils is an add-on to 1.5.2 anyway.

BUILD IT
  python setup.py build

INSTALL IT (usually as root)
  python setup.py install

That's it!


PYTHON VERSIONS LESS THAN 2.0

Need to compile mapscript.c into a shared library called _mapscript.so
on UNICES/Linux and _mapscript.dll (I think) for MS Windows.  Copy
_mapscript.(so|dll), mapscript.py, and dbfreader.py to your Python's
site-packages directory.  That should to it!
