The Python mapscript module provides users an interface to MapServer
classes on any platform, and has been well tested on Python versions
2.1-2.3.4.


Building the Mapscript Module
-----------------------------

if you are using Python 2.2+, copy the mapscript_wrap.c and mapscript.py
files from python/modern up to python/, replacing the files in that
location.  Before you begin, it's worth spending a few minutes to read the
docs about Python distutils:

    http://www.python.org/doc/current/dist/dist.html

Now that you know what distutils does, use it like
::

    $ python setup.py build


Building C Extension Wrappers
-----------------------------

If you are building the mapscript module from CVS, not from a release, the
C extension wrappers will be absent and must then be generated using SWIG,
the Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator, http://www.swig.org.  SWIG
version 1.3.19 or higher is recommended.

From the mapscript/python directory execute
::

    $ swig -python -shadow -o mapscript_wrap.c ../mapscript.i

and then proceed to the build step explained above.  If you are using
Python 2.2 or 2.3, you should add a -modern option which produces a higher
performance module.  ::

    $ swig -python -shadow -modern -o mapscript_wrap.c ../mapscript.i

Testing
-------

Make the appropriate edits to tests/test.map under the mapserver directory,
change directory from mapscript/python and execute ::

    $ cd tests/cases
    $ python runalltests.py -v

The tests can (and should) be run before the module is installed.

Installing
----------

As root or superuser
::
    
    $ python setup.py install

That's it!

MapScript is now using code from gdmodule 

  http://newcenturycomputers.net/projects/gdmodule.html

which makes possible some new and cool imageObj tricks.  The use
this code is **greatly** appreciated and MapServer developers look
forward to being able to share advances with the gdmodule
developers.
