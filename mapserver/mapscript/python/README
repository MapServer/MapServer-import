Python MapScript for MapServer 4.1

BUILD
----------------------------------------------------------------
Before you begin, it's worth spending a few minutes to read the
docs about Python disutils:

http://www.python.org/doc/current/dist/dist.html

Now that you know what disutils does, use it like

  python setup.py build

Note that setup_wnone.py is deprecated since all of its features
have been incorporated into setup.py.

TEST
----------------------------------------------------------------
Make the appropriate edits to tests/test.map under the mapserver
directory and execute

  python tests/testMapScript.py -v

The tests can (and should) be run before the module is installed.


INSTALL
----------------------------------------------------------------
As root or superuser

  python setup.py install

That's it!


TROUBLESHOOTING
----------------------------------------------------------------
People have been reporting segmentation faults with Python
MapScript.  The most common cause of this is improperly
configured map SHAPEPATH and layer DATA.

Here's a sample of how to troubleshoot this issue:

Python 2.1.3 (#18, Jun 24 2003, 18:02:42) 
[GCC 3.1 20020420 (prerelease)] on darwin6
Type "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> from mapscript import mapObj
>>> m = mapObj('tests/test.map')
>>> m
<C mapObj instance at _00df2000_p_mapObj>
>>> import os
>>> for i in range(m.numlayers):                   
...     l = m.getLayer(i)
...     filename = os.path.join(m.shapepath, l.data + '.shp')
...     try:
...         fh = open(filename, 'r')
...         fh.close()
...     except IOError:
...         print "Caught IOError trying to read " + filename
... 
>>> 

In my case the map file is properly configured and the open()
call doesn't raise an IOError.  If your SHAPEPATH and DATA are
bogus, you will see errors raised.

MapScript is now using code from gdmodule 

  http://newcenturycomputers.net/projects/gdmodule.html

which makes possible some new and cool imageObj tricks.  The use
this code is _greatly_ appreciated and MapServer developers look
forward to being able to share advances with the gdmodule
developers.
