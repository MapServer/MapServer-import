	Python MapScript
	================

To build Python mapscript support on Unix:


Setup.py Changes:

 o Set entries in 'define_macros' to match the overall build options in
   the Mapserver makefile.  
 o Add any necessary directories to 'include_dirs'
 o Add *all* libraries that mapserver has to link against to 'libraries'.

Then run 'python setup.py build' to build Python MapScript.  The command
'python setup.py install' may properly install Python mapscript if run as
root, but if not try adding the [mapserverroot]/mapscript/python/lib.* 
directory to your PYTHONPATH. 
 
Good luck!
