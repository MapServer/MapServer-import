Python MapScript Unit Tests
===========================

Author: Sean Gillies, sgillies@frii.com


Running the tests
-----------------

To run the tests, execute 

   python tests/testMapScript.py -v

from the mapscript/python directory of the mapserver distribution.  The
tests cannot be run properly from another path.  By default, the unit
test script will insert the local build directory produced by Python
distutils into the head of the Python PATH.  This allows us to run the
unit tests before installing the mapscript module.  The unit tests use a
map config file, symbolset file, fontset file, and data located in the 
'tests' directory of the mapserver distribution.


New testing framework
---------------------

I'm slowly changing to a state where modules of test cases are kept in
tests/cases.  These cases are incorporated into a test suite module
runtests.py.  The testing.py is a module of mapscript testing utility
classes and functions.

To try the new testing framework, execute

    python tests/runtests.py -v

from the mapscript/python directory.  Eventually all tests in the
testMapScript.py file will be moved into the suite in runtests.py.
