Python MapScript Unit Tests

To run the tests, execute 

   python tests/testMapScript.py -v
   python tests/testCloneMap.py -v

from the mapscript/python directory of the mapserver distribution.  The
tests cannot be run properly from another path.  By default, the unit
test script will insert the local build directory produced by Python
distutils into the head of the Python PATH.  This allows us to run the
unit tests before installing the mapscript module.

The unit tests use a map config file, symbolset file, fontset file, and
data located in the 'tests' directory of the mapserver distribution.  If
you are using TrueType fonts, make the necessary edits to the fontset
file.  If you are not using TrueType fonts, simply ignore the several
resulting test failures.
