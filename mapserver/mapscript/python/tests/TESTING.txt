Python MapScript Unit Tests

To run the tests, execute 

   python tests/testMapScript.py

from the mapscript/python directory.  By default, the unit test
script will insert the local build directory produced by Python
distutils into the head of the Python PATH.  This allows us to
run the unit tests before installing the mapscript module.
