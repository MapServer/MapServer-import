Python MapScript Unit Tests

To run the tests, execute 

   python tests/testMapScript.py

from the mapscript/python directory.  By default, the unit test
script will insert the local build directory produced by Python
distutils into the head of the Python PATH.  This allows us to
run the unit tests before installing the mapscript module.

The unit tests require that the MapServer Itasca demo data be 
installed on your system.  Edit test.map so that SHAPEPATH points
to the proper path.  If your MapServer does not have PROJ.4
compiled in, you will also need to comment out all PROJECTION
blocks.
