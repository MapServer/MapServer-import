                    PHP/MapScript Mapserver Module
                    ==============================

$Id$
                      --------------------------

This is a PHP module to make MapServer's MapScript functionalities 
available in a PHP Dynamically Loadable Library.  

PHP MapScript was originally developed for PHP-3.0.14 and works with more 
recent versions of PHP3.  It has also been ported to PHP4, the MapServer
configure script should automatically detect which version of PHP you are 
attempting to build with and take the necessary actions.

The module has been tested and used on Linux, Solaris, *BSD, and WinNT.

This module is constantly under development, the main resource for help
is the PHP/MapScript web page at:
  http://www2.dmsolutions.on.ca/mapserver/php_mapscript/
and especially the FAQ at:
  http://www2.dmsolutions.on.ca/mapserver/php_mapscript/php_mapscript_faq.html

                      --------------------------

Currently supported classes, properties and methods:
====================================================

For more complete information, see the MapScript documentation at:
	http://mapserver.gis.umn.edu/mapscript.html
and the MapServer Map File documentation at:
	http://mapserver.gis.umn.edu/mapfile.html

  Very important notes:
  ---------------------

  - Constant names and class member variable names are case-sensitive in PHP.

  - Several MapScript functions (all those that access files in the back end
    such as ms_newMapObj(), drawMap(), etc) will affect the value of the 
    current working directory (CWD) in the PHP environment. This will be 
    fixed eventually but in the meantime you should be careful about these 
    side-effects.

   int queryByPoint(pointObj point, int mode, double buffer)
        Query all selected layers in map at point location specified in 
        georeferenced map coordinates (i.e. not pixels).  
        The query is performed on all the shapes that are part of a CLASS 
        that contains a TEMPLATE value or that match any class in a
        layer that contains a LAYER TEMPLATE value.
        Mode is MS_SINGLE or MS_MULTIPLE depending on number of results
        you want. 
        Passing buffer <=0 defaults to tolerances set in the map file 
        (in pixels) but you can use a constant buffer (specified in 
        ground units) instead.
        Returns MS_SUCCESS if shapes were found or MS_FAILURE if nothing
        was found or if some other error happened (note that the error 
        message in case nothing was found can be avoided in PHP using

        that contains a TEMPLATE value or that match any class in a
        layer that contains a LAYER TEMPLATE value.
        Returns MS_SUCCESS if shapes were found or MS_FAILURE if nothing
        was found or if some other error happened (note that the error 
        message in case nothing was found can be avoided in PHP using 
        the '@' control operator).

   int queryByShape(shapeObj shape)

        shape has to be a polygon at this point.
        Returns MS_SUCCESS if shapes were found or MS_FAILURE if nothing
        was found or if some other error happened (note that the error 
        message in case nothing was found can be avoided in PHP using 
        the '@' control operator).

   int queryByFeatures(int slayer) 
        Perform a query based on a previous set of results from
        a layer. At present the results MUST be based on a polygon layer.
        Returns MS_SUCCESS if shapes were found or MS_FAILURE if nothing
        was found or if some other error happened (note that the error 
        message in case nothing was found can be avoided in PHP using 
        the '@' control operator).

   int save(string filename)
        Save current map object state to a file. Returns -1 on error.

        a single string of comma-delimited PROJ.4 parameters.
        The argument : bSetUnitsAndExtents is used to automatically update
        the map units and extents based on the new projection. Possible 
        values are MS_TRUE and MS_FALSE. By defualt it is set at MS_FALSE

   int getMetaData(string name)
        Fetch metadata entry by name (stored in the WEB object in the map
        file).  Returns "" if no entry matches the name.  Note that the
        search is case sensitive.

   int setMetaData(string name, string value)
        Set a metadata entry for the map (stored in the WEB object in the map
        file).  Returns MS_SUCCESS/MS_FAILURE.

 ClassObj Class:
 ---------------

 Constructor:
   Class Objects can be returned by the LayerObj class, or can be created
   using:

   classObj ms_newClassObj(layerObj layer)

 Members:

   string name
   int    type
   int    status      (MS_ON, MS_OFF or MS_DELETE)

   int    size
   int    minsize
   int    maxsize
   int    overlaysymbol
   int    overlaysize
   int    overlayminsize
   int    overlaymaxsize
   labelObj label

 Methods:

   int set(string property_name, new_value)
        Set object property to a new value. Returns -1 on error.

   int setexpression(string expression)
        Set the expression string for the class object.
           
   int settext(string text)
        Set the text string for the class object.
     
 ImageObj Class:
 ---------------

 Constructor:

   Instances of ImageObj are always created by the map class methods.

 Members:

   int    width     (read-only)
   int    height    (read-only)
   string imagepath
   string imageurl

 Methods:

   void free()
        Destroys resources used by an image object.

   int saveImage(string filename, int type, int transparent, int interlace, 
                 int quality)
        Writes image object to specifed filename.
        Passing an empty filename sends output to stdout.  In this case,
        the PHP header() function should be used to set the documents's
        content-type prior to calling saveImage().
        Type can be either MS_GIF, MS_PNG, MS_JPEG or MS_WBMP (depends on
        which version of GD was used to compile MapScript)
        Quality should be a value in the range 0-95, higher value implies
        higher image quality and larger image sizes.
        If quality is negative, then the default IJG JPEG quality value is 
        used (the quality value is ignored for all formats other than JPEG).
        The function returns -1 on error.  On success, it returns either 0
        if writing to an external file, or the number of bytes written if 
        output is sent to stdout.

   string saveWebImage(int type, int transparent, int interlace, int quality)
        Writes image to temp directory.  Returns image URL.
        Type can be either MS_GIF, MS_PNG, MS_JPEG or MS_WBMP (depends on
        which version of GD was used to compile MapScript)
        Quality should be a value in the range 0-95, higher value implies
        higher image quality and larger image sizes.
        If quality is negative, then the default IJG JPEG quality value is 
        used  (the quality value is ignored for all formats other than JPEG).

   void pasteImage(imageObj srcImg, int transparent)
        Copy srcImg on top of the current imageObj.
        Passing transparent = MS_TRUE will set srcImg's background color as
        transparent before copying it on top of the image.

To compile/install the module on Linux:
=======================================

- You may have to start by recompiling Apache and PHP to include PHP as
  a module, there are step by step instructions for that on the PHP web
  site:
	http://www.php.net/manual/install-unix.php

- The main MapServer configure script will automatically setup the main
  makefile to compile php_mapscript.so if you pass the --with-php=DIR
  argument to the configure script.

- Copy the 'php_mapscript.so' library to your PHP extensions directory
  and then use the dl() function to load the module at the beginning of
  your PHP scripts.   See also the PHP function extension_loaded() to
  check whether an extension is already loaded.

- The file mapscript/php3/examples/phpinfo_mapscript.phtml will test 
  that the php_mapscript module is properly installed and can be loaded.

- If you get an error from PHP complaining that it cannot load the 
  library, then make sure that you recompiled and reinstalled PHP with
  support for dynamic libraries.  On RedHat 5.x and 6.x, this means
  adding "-rdynamic" to the CLDFLAGS in the main PHP3 Makefile after
  running ./configure
  Also make sure all directories in the path to the location of 
  php_mapscript.so are at least r-x for the HTTPd user (usually 'nobody'),
  otherwise dl() may complain that it cannot find the file even if it's 
  there.
