                    PHP/MapScript Mapserver Module
                    ==============================

$Id$
                      --------------------------

This is a PHP module to make MapServer's MapScript functionalities 
available in a PHP Dynamically Loadable Library.  

PHP MapScript was originally developed for PHP-3.0.14 but after MapServer
3.5 support for PHP3 has been dropped and as of the last update of this
document, PHP 4.1.2 or more recent was required.

The module has been tested and used on Linux, Solaris, *BSD, and WinNT.

There are documentation and examples for PHP MapScript available via
the MapServer documentation webpage at:
  http://mapserver.gis.umn.edu/doc.html

See also the MapServer Wiki for links to more informations on this module:
  http://mapserver.gis.umn.edu/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?PHPMapScript

                      --------------------------

Currently supported classes, properties and methods:
====================================================

For more information on each class, see also the MapScript documentation at:
	http://mapserver.gis.umn.edu/doc/perlmapscript-reference.html
and the MapServer Map File documentation at:
	http://mapserver.gis.umn.edu/doc/mapfile-reference.html

  Very important notes:
  ---------------------

  - Constant names and class member variable names are case-sensitive in PHP.

  - Several MapScript functions (all those that access files in the back end
    such as ms_newMapObj(), drawMap(), etc) will affect the value of the 
    current working directory (CWD) in the PHP environment. This will be 
    fixed eventually but in the meantime you should be careful about these 
    side-effects.

 MapObj Class:
 -------------

 Constructor:

        Returns a new object to deal with a MapServer map file.

        By default, the SYMBOLSET, FONTSET, and other paths in the mapfile
        are relative to the mapfile location.  If new_map_path is provided
        then this directory will be used as the base path for all the 
        relative paths inside the mapfile.

                             the label cache (ex : map->labelcache->free())
          
 Methods:

   mapObj clone()
        Returns a handle to a new mapObj which is a clone of the current
        mapObj.  All parameters in the current mapObj are copied to the
        new mapObj.  Returns NULL (0) on error.

   int set(string property_name, new_value)
        Set map object property to new value. Returns -1 on error.

   int getsymbolbyname(string symbol_name)  
        Returns the symbol index using the name.

   symbol getsymbolobjectbyid(int symbolid)
        Returns the symbol object using a symbol id. Refer to
        the symbol object reference section for more details.

   void preparequery()
        Calculate the scale of the map and assign it to the map->scale.
             
   imageObj prepareImage()
        Return handle on blank image object.

   imageObj draw()
        Render map and return handle on image object.

   imageObj drawReferenceMap()
        Render reference map and return handle on image object.

   imageObj drawScaleBar()
        Render scale bar and return handle on image object.

   int embedlegend(imageObj image) 
        embeds a legend. Actually the legend is just added to the label 
        cache so you must invoke drawLabelCache() to actually do the 
        rendering (unless postlabelcache is set in which case it is 
        drawn right away).

   int embedScalebar(imageObj image) 
        embeds a scalebar. Actually the scalebar is just added to the label 
        cache so you must invoke drawLabelCache() to actually do the rendering 
        (unless postlabelcache is set in which case it is drawn right away).

   int drawLabelCache(imageObj image)
        Renders the labels for a map. Returns -1 on error.

   layerObj getLayer(int index)
        Returns a layerObj from the map given an index value (0=first layer)

   layerObj getLayerByName(string layer_name)
        Returns a layerObj from the map given a layer name.  
        Returns FALSE if layer doesn't exist.

   colorObj getcolorbyindex(int iCloIndex)
	Returns a colorObj corresponding to the color index in the palette

   void setextent(double minx, double miny, double maxx, double maxy)
	Set the map extents using the georef extents passed in argument.

   int setRotation(double rotation_angle)
        Set map rotation angle. The map view rectangle (specified in 
        EXTENTS) will be rotated by the indicated angle in the counter-
        clockwise direction. Note that this implies the rendered map 
        will be rotated by the angle in the clockwise direction.
        Returns MS_SUCCESS or MS_FAILURE.

   int queryByPoint(pointObj point, int mode, double buffer)
        Query all selected layers in map at point location specified in 
        georeferenced map coordinates (i.e. not pixels).  
        The query is performed on all the shapes that are part of a CLASS 
        that contains a TEMPLATE value or that match any class in a
        layer that contains a LAYER TEMPLATE value.
        Mode is MS_SINGLE or MS_MULTIPLE depending on number of results
        you want. 
        Passing buffer <=0 defaults to tolerances set in the map file 
        (in pixels) but you can use a constant buffer (specified in 
        ground units) instead.
        Returns MS_SUCCESS if shapes were found or MS_FAILURE if nothing
        was found or if some other error happened (note that the error 
        message in case nothing was found can be avoided in PHP using 
        the '@' control operator).

   int queryByRect(rectObj rect)
        Query all selected layers in map using a rectangle specified in 
        georeferenced map coordinates (i.e. not pixels).
        The query is performed on all the shapes that are part of a CLASS 
        that contains a TEMPLATE value or that match any class in a
        layer that contains a LAYER TEMPLATE value.
        Returns MS_SUCCESS if shapes were found or MS_FAILURE if nothing
        was found or if some other error happened (note that the error 
        message in case nothing was found can be avoided in PHP using 
        the '@' control operator).

   int queryByShape(shapeObj shape)
        Query all selected layers in map based on a single shape, the 
        shape has to be a polygon at this point.
        Returns MS_SUCCESS if shapes were found or MS_FAILURE if nothing
        was found or if some other error happened (note that the error 
        message in case nothing was found can be avoided in PHP using 
        the '@' control operator).

   int queryByFeatures(int slayer) 
        Perform a query based on a previous set of results from
        a layer. At present the results MUST be based on a polygon layer.
        Returns MS_SUCCESS if shapes were found or MS_FAILURE if nothing
        was found or if some other error happened (note that the error 
        message in case nothing was found can be avoided in PHP using 
        the '@' control operator).

   int queryByIndex(layerindex, tileindex, shapeindex, addtoquery)
        Add a specific shape on a given layer to the query result.
        If addtoquery (which is a non mandatory argument) is set to MS_TRUE,
        the shape will be added to the existing query list. Default behavaior
        is to free the existing query list and add only the new shape.

   int savequery(filename)
        Save the current query in a file. Returns MS_SUCESS or MS_FAILURE.
        Can be used with loadquery

   int loadquery(filename)
        Loads a query from a file. Returns MS_SUCESS or MS_FAILURE.
        To be used with savequery.

   void freequery(layerindex)
        Frees the query result on a specified layer. If the layerindex is -1,
        all queries on layers will be freed.

   int save(string filename)
        Save current map object state to a file. Returns -1 on error.
        Use absolute path. If a relative path is used, then it will be 
        relative to the mapfile location.

   char getProjection()
        Returns a string represenation of the projection. If no 
        projection is set, MS_FALSE is returned.

   int setProjection(string proj_params, boolean bSetUnitsAndExtents)
        Set map projection and coordinate system.  Parameters are given as 
        a single string of comma-delimited PROJ.4 parameters.
        The argument : bSetUnitsAndExtents is used to automatically update
        the map units and extents based on the new projection. Possible 
        values are MS_TRUE and MS_FALSE. By defualt it is set at MS_FALSE

   int setWKTProjection(string proj_params, boolean bSetUnitsAndExtents)
        Same as setProjection(), but takes an OGC WKT projection 
        definition string as input.

   int getMetaData(string name)
        Fetch metadata entry by name (stored in the WEB object in the map
        file).  Returns "" if no entry matches the name.  Note that the
        search is case sensitive.

   int setMetaData(string name, string value)
        Set a metadata entry for the map (stored in the WEB object in the map
        file).  Returns MS_SUCCESS/MS_FAILURE.

   int removeMetaData(string name)

        Return an array containing all the layer's indexes given
        a group name.

   array getAllGroupNames()
        Return an array containing all the group names used in the
        layers.  

   array getAllLayerNames()
        Return an array containing all the layer names.

   array   getlayersdrawingorder()
        Return an array containing layer's index in the order which they
        are drawn.

   boolean  setlayersdrawingorder(array layeryindex)
        Set the layer's order array. The argument passed must be a valid
        array with all the layer's index. 
        Return TRUE on success or else FALSE.

   string processtemplate(array params, boolean generateimages)
        Process the template file specified in the web object and return 
        the resut in a buffer. 
        The processing consists of opening the template file and replace
        all the tags found in it.
        Only tags that have an equivalent element in the map object are
        replaced (ex [scale]). 
        The are two expetions to the previous statement :
          - [img], [scalebar], [ref], [legend] would be replaced with the 
            appropriate url if the parameter generateimages is set to 
            MS_TRUE. (Note :  the images corresponding to the diffrent objects 
            are generated if the object is set to MS_ON in the map file)
         - the user can use the params parameter to specify tags and 
           their values. For example if the user have a specific tag call
           [my_tag] and would like it to be replaced by "value_of_my_tag"
           he would do :
              $tmparray["my_tag"] = "value_of_my_tag";
              $map->processtemplate($tmparray, MS_FASLE);
         
   string processquerytemplate(array params, boolean generateimages)     
       Process query template files and return the resut in a buffer.
       Second argument generateimages is not manadatory. If not given
        It will be set to TRUE.

       See also : processtemplate function.
   
   string processlegendtemplate(array params)     
       Process legend template files and return the resut in a buffer.

     See also : processtemplate function.

       Load and set a new fontset.
       

   int selectOutputFormat(string type)
        Selects the output format to be used in the map. 
        Returns MS_SUCCESS/MS_FAILURE.
       
        Note : the type used should correspond to one of the output
               formats declared in the map file.
               The type argument passed is compared with the mimetype
               parameter in the output format structure and then to
               the name parameter in the structure. 

   int saveMapContext(string filename)
        Available only if WMS support is enabled.
        Save current map object state in WMS Map Context format. 
        Only WMS layers are saved in the WMS Map Context XML file.
        Returns MS_SUCCESS/MS_FAILURE.

   int loadMapContext(string filename)
        Available only if WMS support is enabled.
        Load a WMS Map Context XML file into the current mapObj.
        If the map already contains some layers then the layers defined
        in the WMS Map context document are added to the current map.
        Returns MS_SUCCESS/MS_FAILURE.


  int applySLD(string sldxml)
        Apply the SLD document to the map file. The matching between the
        sld document and the map file will be done using the layer's name.
        See SLD How to for more information on the SLD support.

  int applySLDURL(string sldurl)
        Apply the SLD document pointed by the URL to the map file. The matching between the
        sld document and the map file will be done using the layer's name.
        See SLD How to for more information on the SLD support.

  char generateSLD()
        Returns an SLD XML string based on all the classes found in all the layers.

 LayerObj Class:
 ---------------

 Constructor:
   Layer Objects can be returned by the MapObj class, or can be created
   using:

   layerObj ms_newLayerObj(MapObj map, layerObj layer)

   A second argument (which is not manadatory) can be given to the  ms_newLayerObj
   to be able to create a new layer based on an existing layer. If a layer is 
   given as argument, all members of a this layer will be copied in the new
   layer created.

 Methods:

   void free()
        Destroys resources used by an image object.

   int saveImage(string filename)
        Writes image object to specifed filename.
        Passing an empty filename sends output to stdout.  In this case,
        the PHP header() function should be used to set the documents's
        content-type prior to calling saveImage().
        The output format is the one that is currently selected in the 
        map file.
        The function returns -1 on error.  On success, it returns either 0
        if writing to an external file, or the number of bytes written if 
        output is sent to stdout.

   void pasteImage(imageObj srcImg, int transparentColorHex 
                   [[, int dstX, int dstY], int angle])
        Copy srcImg on top of the current imageObj.
        transparentColorHex is the color (in 0xrrggbb format) from srcImg 
        that should be considered transparent (i.e. those pixels won't 
        be copied).  Pass -1 if you don't want any transparent color.
        If optional dstx,dsty are provided then it defines the position 
        where the image should be copied (dstx,dsty = top-left corner 
        position).
        The optional angle is a value between 0 and 360 degrees to rotate
        the source image counterclockwise.  Note that if an angle is specified
        (even if its value is zero) then the dstx and dsty coordinates 
        specify the CENTER of the destination area.
        Note: this function works only with 8 bits GD images (PNG or GIF).

gridObj
--------

 Constructor :

   The grid is always embedded inside a layer object defined as
   a grid (layer->connectiontype = MS_GRATICULE)
   (for more docs : http://mapserver.gis.umn.edu/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?MapServerGrid)

   A layer can become a grid layer by adding a grid object to it using :
      ms_newGridObj(layerObj layer)

  Example :   $oLayer = ms_newlayerobj($oMap);
              $oLayer->set("name", "GRID");
              ms_newgridobj($oLayer);

 Method :

   int set(string property_name, new_value)
        Set object property to a new value.


errorObj
--------

   Instances of errorObj are created internally by MapServer as errors
   happen.  Errors are managed as a chained list with the first item being
   the most recent error.  The head of the list can be fetched using 
   ms_GetErrorObj(), and the list can be cleared using ms_ResetErrorList()

 Functions:

   errorObj ms_GetErrorObj()
        Returns a reference to the head of the list of errorObj.

   void ms_ResetErrorList()
        Clear the current error list.  
        Note that clearing the list invalidates any errorObj handles obtained 
        via the $error->next() method.

 Members:

   int      code      /* See error code constants above */
   string   routine
   string   message

 Method:

   errorObj next()
        Returns the next errorObj in the list, or NULL if we reached the end
        of the list.

 Example:
   This example draws a map and reports all errors generated during
   the draw() call, errors can potentially come from multiple layers.

       ms_ResetErrorList();
       $img = $map->draw();
       $error = ms_GetErrorObj();
       while($error && $error->code != MS_NOERR)
       {
           printf("Error in %s: %s<br>\n", $error->routine, $error->message);
           $error = $error->next();
       }



labelcacheObj
------------

Accessible only through the map object (map->labelcache). This object
is only used to give the possiblity to free the label cache 
(map->labelcache->free())


Method:

   boolean free()
        Free the label cache. Returns true on success or false if an error
        occurs.
        Ex : (map->labelcache->free();



symbolObj class
---------------

  Constructor:
        
        symboldid = ms_newsymbolobj(mapObj map, string symbbolname);
        
        Creates a new symbol with default values in the symbolist. 
        Returns the Id of the new symbol. If a symbol with the same
        name exists, It's id will be returned.

  To ge a symbol object, you need to use a function on the mapobject :
        $oSymbol = $map->getsymbolobjectbyid($nId);

  Members

    string name;
    type name;  //Please refer to symbol type constants
    int inmapfile; If set to TRUE, the symbol will be saved inside
                   the mapfile.
    double sizex;
    double sizey
    int numpoints
    int filled;
    int stylelength;

  Functions

     int set(string property_name, new_value)
        Set object property to a new value.

     int setpoints(array double)
        Set the points of the symbol. Note that the values passed if an
        array containing the x and y values of the points. Example
        array[0] = 1  : x value of the first point
        array[1] = 0 : y values of the first point
        array[2] = 1 : x value of the 2nd point
        ....

     int setstyle(array int)
        Set the style of the symbol (used for dash patterns)

      array getpointsarray()
         Returns an array containing the points of the symbol. Refer
         to setpoints to see how the array should be interpreted.

      array getstylearray()  
        Returns an array containing the style.
            
        
    Example of usage : crete a symbol to be used as a dah line

        $nId = ms_newsymbolobj($gpoMap, "mydash");
        $oSymbol = $gpoMap->getsymbolobjectbyid($nId);
        $oSymbol->set("filled", MS_TRUE);
        $oSymbol->set("sizex", 1);
        $oSymbol->set("sizey", 1);
        $oSymbol->set("inmapfile", MS_TRUE);
    
        $aPoints[0] = 1;
        $aPoints[1] = 1;
        $oSymbol->setpoints($aPoints);
    
        $aStyle[0] = 10;
        $aStyle[1] = 5;
        $aStyle[2] = 5;
        $aStyle[3] = 10;
        $oSymbol->setstyle($aStyle);

        $style->set("symbolname", "mydash");
