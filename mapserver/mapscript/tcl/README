Mapscript Tcl Interface

WHAT
It' a Tcl interface for Mapserver.  You can write Tcl scripts to generate
maps, read/write shapefiles, etc.


HOW
A simple 'configure' script and Makefile is included.  The configure is hand
built, rather than being derived from GNU autoconf.  Normally you can just 
type:
	configure
	make
	make install

    to build and install the interface.  Two options are supported:

	configure --with-tcl=[dir]  --with-swig=[dir]

	--with-tcl=[dir]    specify the directory where you installed Tcl,
			    the default is /usr/local.  'configure' looks for
			    $dir/lib/tclConfig.sh for Tcl configure info.

	--with-swig=[dir]   specify the directory where you installed Swig,
			    the default is /usr/local.  'configure' looks for
			    $dir/include/swig.h and $dir/lib/libswig.a.

	** Mapscript source code is presumed to be two directory levels above
	this directory, and uses various .h files from Mapscript, along	
	with ../mapscript.i.

	** Mapscript/Tcl normally builds as a Tcl stubbed dynamic library.
	The makefile includes a target 'nostublib' if you want to build
	with a Tcl version dependent library.

	** Tested with Tcl/Tk version 8.3.2, and Swig version 1.1-883


REQUIREMENTS
You must have Tcl (tcl.sourceforge.net) installed and optionally, Swig 
installed also (www.swig.org).

The current mapscript.i Swig interface definition file is designed for
Swig 1.1 versions.  Newer versions of Swig may require mapscript.i changes.
You should have Tcl 8.3 or greater installed, as the Makefile normally builds
with the Tcl dynamic stubs library.  Tcl 8.3.2 (or current release) is 
recommended.  Additionally, you probably want the Img Tcl extension to
support upcoming Mapserver images (PNG, JPG, etc.)


DOCS
Swig generated documentation, plus and additional doc page for Tcl coded 
helper functions are available as HTML.


EXAMPLES
See the ./examples directory.  

	shpinfo.tcl    - print rudimentary info about a shape file.
