MapServer 4.10 to 5.0 Migration Guide
=====================================

This page documents the changes that must be made to MapServer 
applications when migrating from version 4.10.x (or earlier versions) 
to 5.x (i.e. backwards incompatibilities), as well as information
on some of the new features.

----------------------------------------------------
Mapfile changes
----------------------------------------------------

Attribute Bindings: In an effort to stem the tide of keyword overload
and add functionality MapServer 5.0 supports a new method of binding 
feature attributes to STYLE and LABEL properties. In the past keywords
like ANGLEITEM or LABELSIZEITEM were used, now you denote the attribute
in the context of the property being bound. For example, to bind an 
attribute to a label size you'd do:

LABEL
  ...
  SIZE [mySizeItem]
END

The []'s denote a binding (as with logical expressions). The following
keywords are no longer supported and their presence will throw an error:

Layer: LABELANGLEITEM, LABELSIZEITEM
Style: ANGLEITEM, SIZEITEM

The following properties can accept bindings:

Style: angle, color, outlinecolor, size, symbol
Label: angle, color, outlinecolor, size, font, priority

Colors may be given as a hex value (e.g. #FFFFFF) or an RGB triplet 
(e.g. 255 255 255).

Layer Transparency: The values for the TRANSPARENCY parameter have always
been backwards and in an effort to resolve that the parameter has been
renamed OPACITY. TRANSPARENCY is still recognized by the mapfile parser
but is depricated and should be avoided. 

Scale Paramters: MapServer's handling of scale has long been a source
for confusion. The values use in a layer MINSCALE are really the denominators
from a representative fraction (e.g. 1:24000). To help clarify this all
scale parameters are now end with DENOM. So MINSCALE => MINSCALEDENOM,
SYMBOLSCALE => SYMBOLSCALEDENOM, and so on. The mapfile parser still
recognizes the older keywords but they are depricated and should be avoided. 

--------------
Symbol file changes
--------------

Symbol Style: STYLEs are used within a symbol definition to store dash
patterns for line symbolization. However, there is potential confusion
with the style object that is used within class definitions. To resolve
that confusion the symbol STYLE parameter has been renamed PATTERN. The
symbol file parser will still recognize the STYLE keyword but it is 
depricated and should be avoided.

----------------------------------------------------
Styling/Symbolgy changes
----------------------------------------------------
Prior to MapsServer 5.0, if a pixmap symbol was used in style on a Line
Layer, the symbol was used as a brush to draw the line. In MapServer 5.0, 
it is possible to draw the pixmap symbol along the line (Note that this 
was available using a true type symbol). To achieve  this, the user needs 
to use the parameter GAP with it's pixmap symbol definition in the symbol
file. The GAP represents the distance between the symbols. If the GAP is not
given, the pixmap symbol will be used as a brush.   

----------------------------------------------------
SWIG MapScript (Python, Perl, CSharp, Java) changes
----------------------------------------------------

Layer Transparency: The layerObj transparency parameter is now called
opacity. Scripts setting that value in code must be updated.

Symbol Style: the symbolObj style parameter is now called pattern. MapScript
does not allow direct modification of that parameter. In Swig-based languages
the symbolObj method setStyle is now called setPattern. In PHP/MapScript, the
methods setStyle and getStyle are now called setPattern and getPattern.

CSharp related changes
-----------------------

The MapScript C# classes are now placed into the OSGeo.MapServer namespace
The scripts should use the fully qualified names of the classes or apply 
the 

::

  using OSGeo.MapServer;
  
or the corresponding language equivalent. 

----------------------------------------------------
PHP/MapScript changes
----------------------------------------------------

Layer Transparency: The layerObj transparency parameter is now called
opacity. The old "transparency" name is deprecated and will be removed in
a future release. Scripts getting/setting that value in code must be updated.

All occurences of scale, minscale, maxscale, etc... parameters have been
deprecated and renamed with a "denom" suffix (e.g. minscale becomes 
minscaledenom, etc.). The deprecated parameters will be removed in a
future release. Scripts getting/setting them must be updated.

SymbolObj style has been renamed pattern. The old "stylelength" parameter
and setStyle() and getStyleArray() methods have been deprecated and 
"patternlength", setPattern() and getPatternArray() should be used 
instead. They will be removed in a future release.

OGC Web Mapping Service (WMS)
----------------------------------------------------

OGC Web Feature Service (WFS)
----------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------
Build Changes
----------------------------------------------------

MapServer's main include file has been renamed from "map.h" to "mapserver.h".

A new mapserver-config script has been created with the following options:

  Usage: mapserver-config [OPTIONS]
  Options:
   [--libs]
   [--dep-libs]
   [--cflags]
   [--defines]
   [--includes]
   [--version]

The shared and static link libraries for MapSserver have been renamed
libmapserver.x.y.so and libmapserver.a respectively.
