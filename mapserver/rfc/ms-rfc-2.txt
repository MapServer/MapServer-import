Description: Developing inline features or shapes within MapScript can be a 
bit cumbersome.  One alternative would be to allow users to define feature 
using the Well-Known Text format.  The proposed solution would allow users 
to use this format:

1) within a mapfile
2) via URL
3) via MapScript

Instead of writing a new WKT parser I would provide access to underlying GEOS 
functionality to do this and leverage the Geometry <=> shapeObj wrapper code 
that is already available.

Files affected
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- mapfile.h => new constant
- maplexer.l => recognize the new constant
- mapfile.c => process new mapfile parameter with FEATURE block (WKT), and 
  update URL parsing in a similar manner
- mapgeos.cpp => wrap GEOS WKT reading code
- mapscript/swiginc/shape.i => update constructor to pass a WKT string

Backwards compatabilty issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

N/A, new functionality

Implementation Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Biggest problem may lie with MapScript and how to integrate into the shapeObj 
code. Ideally one would just create an overloaded shapeObj constuctor. It's 
not clear how cross-language that would be although both Perl and Python 
support that via SWIG. Not sure about other SWIGed languages or PHP.  Could 
also consider adding a method like .addWKT. to the layer object.
