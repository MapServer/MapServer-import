:Status: Proposed
:Version: MapServer 5.4

Overview 
--------

Making the options for ignoring missing data in tile-indexed layers and WMS client layers more flexible, and configurable at run-time via the map file.

Technical Solution
------------------

Currently Mapserver has only compile-time (./configure --ignore-missing-data) control of behavior when files referenced in tile indexes are missing, via the IGNORE_MISSING_DATA define, and that behavior is applied globally.

Under this RFC, the missing data behavior will be defined:

 * at run time
 * globally for a map file

As well, the option to "fail on a missing layer" will be added to the WMS client code, which currently defaults to "ignore on a missing layer".

All changes will preserve the current default behavior in cases where new behavior is not requested by the user: missing data in tileindexes will continue to cause failure and missing WMS layers will continue to be ignored, unless Mapserver is compiled with --ignore-missing-data.

A map-level configuration option will be added, CONFIG "ON_MISSING_DATA" "[ACTION]", with the following valid actions: "IGNORE", "LOG", "FAIL".  The default map-level behavior will be "FAIL", unless Mapserver is compiled with --ignore-missing-data, in which case it will be "LOG".  This will preserve the current behavior for all legacy mapfiles and compile set-ups.

At the same time, this ticket (#2722) can probably be tracked down and resolved.

Mapscript Implications
----------------------

None.

Files Affected
--------------

::

 mapshape.c
 mapogr.c
 mapraster.c
 maprasterquery.c

* Documentation will be updated to reflect the new feature

  * Mapserver Mapfile Reference

Backwards Compatibility Issues
------------------------------

None. Legacy mapfiles and compile setups should retain existing behavior in the presence of this new code.
