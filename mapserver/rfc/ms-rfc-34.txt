Overview
--------

This RFC documents the MapServer Release Manager role and the phases of
MapServer's Release Cycle.

The MapServer Release Manager Role
----------------------------------

For every release of MapServer, the PSC elects a release manager (this
is usually done with a motion and vote on the mapserver-dev list).

The overall role of the release manager is to coordinate the efforts
of the developers, testers, documentation and other contributors to
lead to a release of the best possible quality within the scheduled
timeframe. 

The PSC delegates to the release manager the responsibility and 
authority to make certain final decisions for a release, including:

- Approving or not the release of each beta, release candidate and 
  final release
- Approving or rejecting non-trivial bug fixes or changes after the 
  feature freeze
- Maintaining the release schedule (timeline) and making changes as required

When in doubt or for tough decisions (e.g. pushing the release date by
several weeks) the release manager is free to ask the PSC to vote in 
support of some decisions, but this is not a requirement for the areas of 
responsibility above.

The release manager's role also includes the following tasks:

- Setup and maintain the Release Plan section of the website for
  this release
- Coordinate with the developers team
- Coordinate with the QA/testers team
- Coordinate with the docs/website team
- Keep track of progress via Trac (make use of Trac milestones and ensure
  tickets are properly targeted, push some tickets to a later release if 
  required, etc.)
- Organize regular IRC meetings (including agenda and minutes)
- Tag source code in SVN for each beta, RC and release
- Branch source code in SVN after the final release (trunk becomes the next
  dev version)
- Update map.h and HISTORY.TXT for each beta/RC/release
- Update appropriate website/download page for each beta/RC/release
- Make announcements on mapserver-users and mapserver-announce for 
  each release
- Produce/coordinate bugfix releases as needed during the 6 months period
  that follows the final release (i.e. until the next release) 

Any of the above tasks can be delegated but they still remain the ultimate
responsibility of the release manager.


The MapServer release cycle
---------------------------

(Credit: Inspired by the Plone release process at 
http://plone.org/documentation/manual/plone-developer-reference/overview/release-process)

MapServer uses a time-based release cycle, trying to aim for one
release every 6 months.

The normal development cycle of a MapServer release consists of various 
phases.

- Development phase

  The development phase usually lasts around 4 months. New features are
  proposed via RFCs voted by the MapServer PSC.

- RFC freeze date

  For each release there is a certain date by which all new feature 
  proposals (RFCs) must have been submitted for review. After this date no 
  features will be accepted anymore for this particular release.

- Feature freeze date / Beta releases

  By this date all features must have been completed and all code has 
  to be integrated. Only non-invasive changes, user interface work and 
  bug fixes are done now. We usually plan for 3-4 betas and a couple of
  release candidates over a 6 weeks period before the final release.

- Release Candidate

  Ideally, the last beta that was bug free. No changes to the code. 
  Should not require any migration steps apart from the ones required 
  in the betas. If any problems are found and fixed, a new release 
  candidate is issued.

- Final release / Expected release date

  Normally the last release candidate that was issued without any 
  show-stopper bugs.

- Bug fix releases

  No software is perfect. Once a sufficient large or critical number 
  of bugs have been found for a certain release, the release manager 
  releases a new bug fix release a.k.a. third-dot release (for example 4.10.2).
