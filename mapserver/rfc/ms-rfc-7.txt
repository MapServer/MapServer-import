Purpose
-------

To formalize CVS commit access, and specify some guidelines for CVS 
committers.


Election to CVS Commit Access
-----------------------------

Permission for CVS commit access shall be provided to new developers only
if accepted by the MapServer Technical Steering Committee.   A proposal
should be written to the TSC for new committers and voted on normally.  It
is not necessary to write an RFC document for these votes ... email to 
mapserver-dev is sufficient.

Removal of CVS commit access should be handled by the same process.  


Committer Tracking
------------------

A list of all project committers will be kept in the main mapserver 
directory (called COMMITTERS) listing for each CVS committer:

 * Userid: the id that will appear in the CVS logs for this person.

 * Full name: the users actual name. 

 * Email address: A current email address at which the committer can be
   reached.  It may be altered in normal ways to make it harder to 
   auto-harvest. 

 * A brief indication of areas of responsibility.  


CVS Administrator
-----------------

One member of the Technical Steering Committee will be designed the CVS
Administrator.  That person will be responsible for giving CVS commit
access to folks, updating the COMMITTERS file, and other CVS related 
management.  That person will need login access on the CVS server of course.
Initially Steve Lime will be the CVS Adminstrator. 


CVS Commit Practices
--------------------

The following are considered good CVS commit practices for the MapServer
project. 

 * Use meaningful descriptions for CVS commit log entries. 

 * Prefix CVS commit log entries with "Bug 1232: " when committing fixes for
   bugs in Bugzilla.  

 * Include an entry in the HISTORY file for any non-trivial changes committed
   in the main MapServer source tree.  Make sure it is placed under the
   correct version heading and include bug numbers in these messages too.

 * Changes should not be committed in stable branches without a corresponding
   bug id and HISTORY entry.  Any change worth pushing into the stable 
   version is worth a bugzilla bug and good HISTORY notations. 

 * Do not create new branches without the approval of the TSC.  Release
   managers are assumed to have permission to create a branch.
