TinyOWS is a simple WMS and WFS server based on PostGIS spatial database.

TinyOWS was writed with following things in mind:

- KISS approach !

- OGC standart as compliant as possible, aim to support:
   - WMS (1.1.1 and 1.3.0)
   - WFS (1.0 and 1.1)
   - SLD (1.0 and 1.1)
   - FE (1.0 and 1.1)
	
- Performance is matter, maps are cools as they're quick to display !

- Graphical renderer is browser jobs (SVG for the moment)

- Clean code source 



Quality code policy
All code must check following rules :
- gcc -ansi -pedantic -Wall compile without any warning (make)
- Unit test battery without error (make check)
- Unit test with Valgrind error and leak free (make valgrind)
- Doxygen comments (make doxygen)
