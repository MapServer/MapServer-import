TinyOWS is a simple WFS-T server based on PostGIS spatial database.

TinyOWS was writed with following things in mind:

- KISS approach !

- OGC standart as compliant as possible, aim to support:
   - WFS (1.0 and 1.1)
   - FE (1.0 and 1.1)
	
- Performance is matter, maps are cools as they're quick to display !

- Clean code source 



Quality code policy
All code must check following rules :
- gcc -ansi -pedantic -Wall compile without any warning (make)
- Unit test with Valgrind error and leak free (make valgrind)
- Doxygen comments (make doxygen)
- Extensive assert use

Code dynamically linked with following other librairies
- postgresql 8.x
- libxml2.x
