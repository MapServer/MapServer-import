Version 3.3.007

 - Initial coding.

Version 3.3.008

 - Changed setting of MS_TEMPLATE_EXPR to allow template files ending in .htm and .html. (map.h)

 - Added ellipse line symbol. (symbols/line.sym)

 - Initial SDE support coding, actually just the intent to code, skeleton code. (mapsde.c/Makefile)
   
 - Fixed URL based setting of class expression and text. (mapfile.c)

 - Added query read/write support. (map.h/mapquery.c/mapserv.h/mapserv.c)

 - Fixed bug with embedded scalebar/legend and queries. (mapserv.c)

 - Moved EMBED option for scalebar/legend to status. (map.h/mapfile.c/mapfile.h/maplexer.l/maputil.c)

 - Added POSTLABELCACHE option to legend/scalebar/layer. This allow the drawing of certain layers and/or map 
   elements after the labels have been rendered. (map.h/mapfile.c/mapfile.h/maplexer.l/maputil.c/mapscale.c/maplegend.c)

 - Added auto detection of LAT/LON mapxy and mapext paramters to mapserv. (mapserv.c)

 - Fixed "off-by-one" loop error in feature projection routines. (mapproject.c)

 - Fixed error that cause unprojected search extent to be used with projected data. (mapsearch.c)

 - Found/fixed obscure bug with POLYLINE rendering that caused the feature not to be closed when drawn.
   As a result all closed shapes must have first vertex equal last vertex. Polygon clipper enforces this
   now as well. msImagePolygon function removed. (mapprimative.c/mapsymbol.c)

Version 3.3.009

 - Added prototypes for several core initialization/building functions in 
   mapfile.c to map.h. (map.h and others...)

 - Fixed a couple of function name changes that didn't get moved into mapscript.

 - Changed return type for initClass() in mapfile.c.

Version 3.3.010

 - Fixed clipping error with inline polygon features (maputil.c).

 - Added URL support for changing projections (mapfile.c).

 - Updated PROJ support to use version 4.4 available at http://www.remotesensing.org/proj.

 - Integrated UMN EGIS package into core distribution. EGIS will be distributed seperately.

 - Fixed multiline TrueType font problems (maplabel.c).

 - Fixed obscure error in EPPL code related to copying an existing colormap (mapraster.c).

 - Added URL support for changing query parameters (mapfile.c).

 - Added TOLERANCEUNITS parameter to support non-image based point queries.

 - Added support to calculate image size based on extents (maputil.c). 

 - Added queryObj support to mapscript.

 - Cleaned up Makefile to make it more robust when not using default settings.

 - Added Python and Java bindings for mapscript.

 - Modified shapeObj structure (mapprimative.h) to hold a generic type value. This allows
   type-based processing within mapscript under certain conditions. May well be useful for
   other purposes in the future.

 - Fixed msWhichShapesProj() function. A typo had broken spatial indexes (mapsearch.c).

 - Reworked several functions is mapshape.c for effeciency and to be more compatible with
   scripting environments.

 - Added several feature based comparison methods (i.e. contains, distance, and intersects)
   to mapscript.
