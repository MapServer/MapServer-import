MapServer Revision History
==========================

This is a human-readable revision history which will attempt to document
required changes for users to migrate from one version of MapServer to the
next.  Developers are strongly encouraged to document their changes and
their impacts on the users here.  (Please add the most recent changes to 
the top of the list.)

For a complete change history, please see the CVS log comments.  A copy of
the CVS logs is updated daily at the following URL:

Version 4.0-dev (CVS)
------------------------------

- Added prototype of FastCGI support in mapserv_fcgi.c (not built by default).

Version 4.0-beta1 (2003-06-06)
------------------------------

- Added imagemap outputformat, which makes possible use of client-side 
  imagemaps in browsers

- Added MySQL support for non-spatial OpenGIS Simple Features SQL stored data

- msQueryByShape and msQueryByFeature honor layer tolerances. In effect you
  can to buffered queries now. At the momoment only polygon select features
  are supported, but there's nothing inherent in the underlying computations
  that says lines won't work as well.

- Simple one-to-one joins are working again. Reworked the join code so that
  table connections are persistant within a join (across joins is a todo).
  Joins, like layers are wrapped with a connection neutral front end, that
  sets us up to do MySQL or whatever in addition to XBase.

- Removed shapepath argument to all layer access functions (affects MapScript).
  It's still used but we leverage the layer pointer back to the parent mapObj
  so the API is cleaner.

- Changed default presentation of feature attributes to escape a few 
  problematic characters for HTML display (eg. > becomes &gt;). 
  Added [itemname_raw] substitution to allow access to unaltered data.

- Added initial version of Jan Hartman's connection pooling code.

- Replaced libwww with libcurl for WMS/WFS client HTTP requests.
  (libcurl 7.10 required, see http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/)

- Added CONNECTION to the list of mapfile parameters that can accept 
  %variable% substitutions when processed by the cgi version. This is useful
  for passing in username and/or passwords to database data sources.

- Added support for DATA and TEMPLATE (header/footer/etc...) filtering using
  an regex declared in the mapfile (DATAPATTERN and TEMPLATEPATTERN). 
  Certain parameters in a mapfile cannot be changed via a URL without first
  being filtered.

- Added support for enviroment variable MS_MAPFILE_PATTERN. This allows you to
  override the default regex in favor of one more restrictive (I would hope) of
  your own.

- Disabled CGI SAVEMAP option.

- Removed CGI TEMPLATE option since you can use the map_web_template syntax.
  Simplifies security maintenance by only having to deal with this option 
  in a single place.

- Added offset support (styleObj) for raster based output (GD for sure, not
  quite sure how OGR output is created although I believe is uses GD anyway).
  This allows for feature drop shadows and support for cool linear symbols
  like used to be supported in pre-3.4 versions. These offsets are not 
  scalable at the moment.

- Null shapes (attributes but no vertices) are skipped for shapefiles using
  the msLayerNextShape interface. Otherwise applications should check the
  shapeObj type member for MS_SHAPE_NULL.

- Changed where label cache is allocated and cleared. Now it isn't allocated 
  until drawing takes place. Any old cache is cleared before a new one is
  allocated. The cache is still intact following rendering for post-processing
  using MapScript.

- Fixed screw up in pre-processing of logical expressions for item lists.
  Under certain circumstances that list could get corrupted and expressions
  would fail.

- Added NOT operator to expression parser.

- Added layer and map level DEBUG options to map file.

- Major changes to support vector output (PDF, SWF, GML, ...):
   - imageObj is used by all rendering functions instead of gdImagePtr
   - New msSaveImage() prototype
  *** Full details still have to be documented here...

- Support for GD-2.0, including 24 bits output
  *** Full details still have to be documented here...

- Support for output to any GDAL-supported format.
  *** Full details still have to be documented here...

- New styleObj
  *** Full details still have to be documented here...

- PostGIS: Added Sean Gillies <sgillies@i3.com>'s patch for "using unique 
  <column name>". Added "using SRID=#" to specify a spatial reference 
  for an arbitrary sql query.


Version 3.6.0-beta1 (2002-04-30)
--------------------------------

- MapScript: qitem and qstring params added to layer->queryByAttribute().
  Instead of being driven by the layer's FILTER/FILTERITEM, the query by
  attribute is now driven by the values passed via qitem,qstring, and the 
  layer's FILTER/FILTERITEM are ignored.

- Symbol and MapFile changes:
   ANTIALIAS and FILLED keywords now take a boolean (TRUE/FALSE) argument
   i.e.   ANTIALIAS becomes ANTIALIAS TRUE
   and    FILLED    becomes FILLED TRUE

- Reference Map:
  Added options to show a different marker when the reference box becomes
  too small.  See the mapfile reference docs for more details on the new 
  reference object parameters (MARKER, MARKERSIZE, MAXBOXSIZE, MINBOXSIZE)

- Added MINSCALE/MAXSCALE at the CLASS level.

- Support for tiled OGR datasets.

- PHP 4.1.2 and 4.2.0 support for PHP MapScript.

- Added LAYER TRANSPARENCY, value between 1-100

- Fixes to the SWIG interface for clean Java build.

- New HTML legend templates for CGI and MapScript.  See HTML-Legend-HOWTO.

- WMS server now supports query results using HTML query templates instead
  of just plain/text.

- Added support functions for thread safety (--with-thread).  Still not 
  100% thread-safe.
