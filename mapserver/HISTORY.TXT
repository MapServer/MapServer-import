Version 3.6.1 (2002-06-20)
--------------------------

- Fixed a performance problem in msImageFilledPolygon() (bug 162)
  3.6.0 was up to 50% slower than 3.5 rendering polygons, and now
  3.6.1 is up to 10-20% faster than 3.5.

- Removed obsolete PHP3 stuff in README files and configure scripts.

- Fixed color problem with crosshair in reference map.

- Fixed an issue with "LOCATION TINY" being output in legend label objects.

- Postgis bug 165: fix dont_force() to allow for POINT shapes 


Version 3.6.0 (2002-05-28)
--------------------------

- No change since 3.6.0-beta2


Version 3.6.0-beta2 (2002-05-23)
--------------------------------

- A few fixes.

- PostGIS: Added Sean Gillies <sgillies@i3.com>'s patch for "using unique 
  <column name>". Added "using SRID=#" to specify a spatial reference 
  for an arbitrary sql query.

- WMS Capabilities XML: Return grouped/ungrouped layers in an order closer
  to the natural mapfile order (bug 154)

- Integrated patch from Tim Mackey to support ROSA applet parameters via 
  mapserv CGI, see: 
  http://mapserver.gis.umn.edu/wilma/mapserver-users/0011/msg00077.html


Version 3.6.0-beta1 (2002-04-30)
--------------------------------

- MapScript: qitem and qstring params added to layer->queryByAttribute().
  Instead of being driven by the layer's FILTER/FILTERITEM, the query by
  attribute is now driven by the values passed via qitem,qstring, and the 
  layer's FILTER/FILTERITEM are ignored.

- Symbol and MapFile changes:
   ANTIALIAS and FILLED keywords now take a boolean (TRUE/FALSE) argument
   i.e.   ANTIALIAS becomes ANTIALIAS TRUE
   and    FILLED    becomes FILLED TRUE

- Reference Map:
  Added options to show a different marker when the reference box becomes
  too small.  See the mapfile reference docs for more details on the new 
  reference object parameters (MARKER, MARKERSIZE, MAXBOXSIZE, MINBOXSIZE)

- Added MINSCALE/MAXSCALE at the CLASS level.

- Support for tiled OGR datasets.

- PHP 4.1.2 and 4.2.0 support for PHP MapScript.

- Added LAYER TRANSPARENCY, value between 1-100

- Fixes to the SWIG interface for clean Java build.

- New HTML legend templates for CGI and MapScript.  See HTML-Legend-HOWTO.

- WMS server now supports query results using HTML query templates instead
  of just plain/text.

- Added support functions for thread safety (--with-thread).  Still not 
  100% thread-safe.


Version 3.5.0 (2002-12-18)
