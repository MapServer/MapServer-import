Version 3.6-dev (CVS)
---------------------

- Major changes to support vector output (PDF, SWF, GML, ...):
   - imageObj is used by all rendering functions instead of gdImagePtr
   - New msSaveImage() prototype
  Full details still have to be documented...

- MapScript: qitem and qstring params added to layer->queryByAttribute().
  Instead of being driven by the layer's FILTER/FILTERITEM, the query by
  attribute is now driven by the values passed via qitem,qstring, and the 
  layer's FILTER/FILTERITEM are ignored.

- Symbol and MapFile changes:
   ANTIALIAS and FILLED keywords now take a boolean (TRUE/FALSE) argument
   i.e.   ANTIALIAS becomes ANTIALIAS TRUE
   and    FILLED    becomes FILLED TRUE

- Reference Map:
  Added options to show a different marker when the reference box becomes
  too small.  See the mapfile reference docs for more details on the new 
  reference object parameters (MARKER, MARKERSIZE, MAXBOXSIZE, MINBOXSIZE)

- Added MINSCALE/MAXSCALE at the CLASS level.

- Support for tiled OGR datasets.

- PHP 4.1.2 and 4.2.0 support for PHP MapScript.

- Added LAYER TRANSPARENCY, value between 1-100

- Fixes to the SWIG interface for clean Java build.

- New HTML legend templates for CGI and MapScript.  See HTML-Legend-HOWTO.

- WMS server now supports query results using HTML query templates instead
  of just plain/text.

- Added support functions for thread safety (--with-thread).  Still not 
  100% thread-safe.
