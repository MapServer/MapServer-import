Fontsets are very simple lookup tables so that you can use simple aliases to
refer to fonts rather than cryptic file names. The format is as follows:

[font file]	[font alias]

The font file is either fullpath or a path relative to the fontset file. Font
alias can be up to 20 chars and is a short name by which you may refer to fonts
in your map files.

We can't distribute any TrueType fonts with the system, but there are lots of good
free ones available on the net. Visit the FreeType homepage (http://www.freetype.org/)
for lots of good pointers.
