========================================================================		
MapServer Overview
========================================================================
In its most basic form, MapServer is a CGI program that sits inactive on your 
Web server.  When a request is sent to MapServer, it uses information passed 
in the request URL and the Map File to create an image of the requested map.    
The request may also return images for legends, scale bars, reference maps, 
and values passed as CGI variables.  Here is a conceptual 

.. image:: ../images/msappdiagram.png
of a typical MapServer application.


MapServer can be greatly extended and customized.  It can be built to support 
many different input data formats and output types.  This is done at the time 
the MapServer binary is compiled.  See the 
`MapServer Home Page <http://ms.gis.umn.edu>`__ for a 
full list of current features.  Many of the features that are not 'built-in', 
are enabled through the use of 
`OGR <http://ms.gis.umn.edu/docs/howto/ogr_howto/>`__.

=========================================================================
MapScript
=========================================================================

MapScript provides a scripting interface for MapServer for the construction 
of Web and stand-alone applications.  MapScript is used independently of 
CGI MapServer, it is a loadable module that adds MapServer capability to 
your favorite scripting language.  MapScript currently exists in Php, 
Perl, Python, Ruby, Tcl, Java, and C# flavors.  (Describe how SWIG fits in).  

This New User Guide will not explicitly discuss MapScript, check out the
:ref:`MapScript Reference <mapscript>` for more information.

=========================================================================
Anatomy of a MapServer Application
=========================================================================

A simple MapServer application consists of:

* **Map File** - a structured text configuration file for your MapServer 
  application.  It defines the area of your map, tells the MapServer program 
  where your data is and where to output images.  It also defines your map 
  layers, including their data source, projections, and symbology.  
  It usually as a .map extension.
 
* **Geographic Data** - MapServer can utilize many geographic data source types. 
  The default format is the ESRI shapefile.  Many other data formats can be 
  supported, this is discussed further below in `Adding data to your site`_.
 
* **HTML Pages** - the interface between the user and MapServer .  
  They normally sit in Web root.  In it's simplest form, MapServer can be called 
  to place a static map image on a html page.  To make the map interactive, 
  the image is placed in an html form on a page.  
 
  CGI programs are 'stateless', every request they get is new  and they don't 
  remember anything about the last time that they were hit by your application.  
  For this reason, every time your application sends a request to MapServer, 
  it needs to pass context information (what layers are on, where you are on 
  the map, application mode, etc.) in hidden form variables or URL variables.  

  A simple application may include two html pages:

  * **Initialization File** - uses a form with hidden variables to send an 
    initial query to the http server and MapServer.  This form could be placed 
    on another page or be replaced by passing the initialization information 
    as variables in a URL.

  * **Template File** - controls how the maps and legends output by MapServer 
    will appear in the browser.    By referencing MapServer CGI variables in the 
    template html, you allow MapServer to populate them with values related to 
    the current state of your application  (e.g. map image name, reference image 
    name, map extent, etc.)  as it creates the html page for the browser to read.  
    The template also determines how the user can interact with the MapServer 
    application (browse, zoom, pan, query).  

* **MapServer CGI** - The binary or executable file that receives requests and 
  returns images, data, etc.  It sits in the cgi-bin or scripts directory of 
  the http server.  The Web server user must have execute rights for the 
  directory that it sits in, and for security reasons, it should not be in 
  the web root.  
 
* **HTTP Server** - serves up the html pages when hit by the user's browser.  
  You need a working HTTP (Web) server, such as 
  `Apache <http://httpd.apache.org>`__ or Microsoft Internet Information 
  Server, on the machine on which you are installing MapServer.      

=========================================================================
Getting Started
=========================================================================

The best strategy for learning how to build MapServer applications and 
understand how it all works is to start very simple.  Even if your ultimate 
goal is to build a very complex, cutting edge application, make the first 
step a small one.  Get the simple demo running and then morph it into your 
own application.  Here is what you need to get started:

------------------------------
Hardware Requirements
------------------------------

MapServer runs on Linux, Windows, Mac OS X, Solaris, and more.   
To compile or install some of the required programs, you may need 
administrative rights to the machine. People commonly ask questions about 
minimum hardware specifications for MapServer applications, but the answers 
are really specific to the individual application.  For development and 
learning purposes, a very minimal machine will work fine.   

------------------------------
Software Requirements
------------------------------

You need a working and properly configured HTTP (Web) server, such as 
`Apache <http://httpd.apache.org/>`__ or Microsoft Internet Information 
Server, on the machine on which you are installing MapServer.  If you are on 
a Windows machine, and you don't have a HTTP server installed, you may want 
to check out `MS4W <http://www.maptools.org/ms4w/index.phtml>`__, which will 
install a preconfigured HTTP server, MapServer, and more.  The `FGS Linux Installer <http://www.maptools.org/fgs/>`__ provides similar functionality for several Linux distributions.   

You will also need a Web browser, and a text editor (vi, emacs, 
notepad, homesite) to modify your html and Map files.  

------------------------------
Skills
------------------------------

In addition to learning how the different components of a MapServer 
application work together and learning Map File syntax, building a basic 
application requires some conceptual understanding and proficiency in 
several skill areas.  

You need to be able to create or at least modify 
`HTML <http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Guide/>`__ pages and understand how HTML forms 
work.  Since the primary purpose of a MapServer application is to create maps, 
you will also need to understand the basics of geographic data and likely, map 
projections.  As your applications get more complex, skills in SQL, 
DHTML/Javascript, Java, databases, expressions, compiling, and scripting 
may be very useful.  

========================================================================
Build your first MapServer Application
========================================================================

------------------------------
Get MapServer Running
------------------------------

Download the appropriate source code or pre-compiled binaries for 
your operating system from 
`OSGeo <http://download.osgeo.org/mapserver/>`__ or 
`MapTools <http://www.maptools.org/ms4w/index.phtml?page=downloads.html>`__.  `FGS <http://www.maptools.org/fgs/>`__ from maptools.org provides a stand-alone environment that includes Apache http server, MapServer, and PHP MapScript.

Compilation instructions are available for 
:ref:`Unix/Linux <unix>` and 
:ref:`Windows <win32>`, with 
additional `Build Notes for 
RedHat <http://ms.gis.umn.edu/docs/howto/RedHat9andMapServer40>`__.  
`Refractions Research Inc <http://www.refractions.net/>`__ also maintains a set 
of `Linux RPMs <http://postgis.refractions.net/rpms/>`__.  If you are on the 
Windows platform, compilation can be quite challenging, for your first application, 
it is recommended that you utilize pre-compiled Windows binaries.     

Once MapServer is installed, there are two ways that you can test it.  First, 
at the command line, type 'mapserv -v', you should see a message describing 
your MapServer install, something like:

::

   MapServer version 4.8.0-beta2 OUTPUT=GIF OUTPUT=PNG
   OUTPUT=JPEG OUTPUT=WBMP SUPPORTS=PROJ SUPPORTS=FREETYPE
   SUPPORTS=WMS_SERVER INPUT=SHAPEFILE DEBUG=MSDEBUG  

You can also send a HTTP request directly to the MapServer CGI program without 
passing any configuration variables  
(e.g. http://your.domain.name/cgi-bin/ms4/mapserv.exe).  If you receive the 
message, 'No query information to decode. QUERY_STRING not set.', your 
installation is working.

------------------------------
Get Demo Running
------------------------------

Download the `MapServer Demo <http://maps.dnr.state.mn.us/mapserver_demos/workshop-5.0.zip>`__.  
UnZip it and follow the directions in ReadMe.txt.  You will need to move the 
demo files to their appropriate locations on your HTTP server, and modify the 
Map File and html pages to reflect the paths and URLs of your server.   Next, 
point your browser to init.html and hit the 'initialize button'.  If you get 
errors, verify that you have correctly modified the demo files.  

=========================================================================
Making the Site Your Own
=========================================================================

Now that you have a working MapServer demo, you can use the demo to display 
your own data.  Add new LAYERs to your Map file that refer to your own 
geographic data layers.  (You will probably want to delete the existing layers 
or set their status to OFF.)

Unless you are adding layers that fall within the same geographic area as the 
demo, modify `MAP <http://ms.gis.umn.edu/docs/reference/mapfile/mapObj>`__ EXTENT 
to match the extent of your data.  To determine the extent of your data, you can 
use `OGRInfo <http://www.remotesensing.org/gdal/ogr/ogr_utilities.html>`__.  
If you have access to a GIS, you could use that as well.  Map EXTENT needs to 
be in the units of your output projection.
	
If you add geographic data layers of different projections, you will need to 
modify your Map File to add a PROJECTION block to the 
`MAP Object <http://ms.gis.umn.edu/docs/reference/mapfile/mapObj>`__ 
(output projection ) and each of the 
`LAYER <http://ms.gis.umn.edu/docs/reference/mapfile/layer>`__ (existing layer projection).

------------------------------
Adding Data to Your Site
------------------------------

MapServer supports several data input formats 'natively', and many more if 
it is compiled with the open source libraries 
`GDAL <http://gdal.maptools.org/>`__ and `OGR <http://ogr.maptools.org/>`__.

Vector Data
------------------------------

Vector data includes features made up of points, lines, and polygons.  
MapServer supports ESRI shapefiles by default, but it can be compiled to 
support spatially enabled databases such as 
`PostgreSQL-PostGIS <http://postgis.refractions.net/>`__, 
`Geography Markup Language (GML) <https://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=7174>`__, 
`MapInfo <http://www.mapinfo.com/>`__, delimited text files, and more formats with 
`OGR <http://ogr.maptools.org/ogr_formats.html>`__.  See the 
`OGR HowTo <http://ms.gis.umn.edu/docs/howto/ogr_howto>`__ for more info. 

See the `Vector Data Reference Guide 
<http://ms.gis.umn.edu/docs/reference/vector_data>`__ for examples on how to add different 
geographic data sources to your MapServer project.    

Raster Data
------------------------------

Raster data is image or grid data.  By default, MapServer supports 
Tiff/GeoTiff, and EPPL7.  With `GDAL <http://gdal.maptools.org/>`__, it 
supports GRASS, Jpeg2000, ArcInfo Grids, and 
`more formats <http://gdal.maptools.org/formats_list.html>`__.  If you do compile 
MapServer with GDAL, which includes tiff support, do not compile with native tiff 
support, as this will cause a conflict.  More specific information can be found in 
the `Raster Data HowTo <http://ms.gis.umn.edu/docs/howto/raster_data>`__.

------------------------------
Projections
------------------------------

Because the earth is round and your monitor (or paper map) is flat, distortions 
will occur when you display geographic data in a two-dimensional image.  
Projections allow you to represent geographic data on a flat surface.   In 
doing so, some of the original properties (e.g. area, direction, distance, 
scale or conformality)of the data will be distorted.  Different projections 
excel at accurately portraying different properties.  A good 
`primer <http://www.colorado.edu/geography/gcraft/notes/mapproj/mapproj_f.html>`__ 
on map projections  can be found at the University of Colorado.

With MapServer, if you keep all of your spatial data sets in the same projection 
(or unprojected Latitude and Longitude), you do not need to include any 
projection info in your Map File.  In building your first MapServer 
application, this simplification is recommended.  

On-the-fly projection can be accomplished when MapServer is compiled with 
`Proj.4 <http://ms.gis.umn.edu/docs/howto/raster_data>`__ support.  
Instructions on how to enable Proj.4 support on Windows can be found 
on the old `Wiki <http://mapserver.gis.umn.edu/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?WindowProjHowTo>`__.

=========================================================================
Enhancing your site
=========================================================================

------------------------------
Adding Query Capability
------------------------------

There are two primary ways to query spatial data.  Both methods return data 
through the use of templates and CGI variable replacement.  A 
`QUERYMAP <http://ms.gis.umn.edu/docs/reference/mapfile/querymap>`__ can be 
used to map the results of the query. 

To be queryable, each mapfile 
`LAYER <http://ms.gis.umn.edu/docs/reference/mapfile/layer>`__ must 
have a TEMPLATE defined, or each 
`CLASS <http://ms.gis.umn.edu/docs/reference/mapfile/class>`__ within 
the LAYER must have a TEMPLATE defined.  More information about the CGI 
variables used to define queries can be found in the 
`MapServer CGI Reference <http://ms.gis.umn.edu/docs/reference/cgi>`__.

Attribute queries
-----------------------------

The user selects features based on data associated with that feature.  
'Show me all of the lakes where depth is greater than 100 feet', with 
'depth' being a field in the shapefile .dbf or the spatial database.  
Attribute queries are accomplished by passing query definition information 
to MapServer in the URL (or form post).  Mode=itemquery returns a single 
result, and mode=itemnquery returns multiple result sets.  

The request must also include a QLAYER, which identifies the layer to 
be queried, and a 
`QSTRING <http://mapserver.gis.umn.edu/doc44/cgi-reference.html#qstring>`__, 
which contains the query string.  
Optionally, `QITEM <http://mapserver.gis.umn.edu/doc44/cgi-reference.html#qitem>`__, 
can be used in conjunction with QSTRING to define the field to be queried.  
Attribute queries only apply within the EXTENT set in the map file.  

Spatial queries
------------------------------

The user selects features based on a click on the map or a user-defined 
selection box.  Again the request is passed through a URL or form post.  
By setting mode=QUERY, a user click will return the one closest feature. 
In mode=NQUERY, all features found by a map click or user-defined selection 
box are returned.  Additional query options can be found in the 
`MapServer CGI Reference <http://ms.gis.umn.edu/docs/reference/cgi>`__

------------------------------
Interfaces
------------------------------

Once they have a basic MapServer application going, people often want to 
add additional functionality and a more sophisticated interface that isn't 
possible with a straight HTML template.  One can use DHTML, Java, and 
Flash on the client side to improve the interface.    Demos for 
`DHTML <http://maps.dnr.state.mn.us/mapserver_demos/workshop.zip>`__  and 
`Flash <http://mapserver.gis.umn.edu/user_utilities/fmv.zip>`__ interfaces 
are available for download.  
`JBox <http://ms.gis.umn.edu/docs/howto/jbox>`__ is a Java applet for 
building MapServer interfaces. 

------------------------------	
Data Optimization
------------------------------

Data organization is at least as important as hardware configuration in 
optimizing a MapServer application for performance.  MapServer is quite 
efficient at what it does, but by reducing the amount of processing that 
it needs to do at the time of a user request, you can greatly increase 
performance.  Here are a few rules:

* **Index Your data** - By creating spatial indexes for your shapefiles 
  using `shptree <http://mapserver.gis.umn.edu/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?ShpTree>`__.  
  Spatial indexes should also be created for spatially aware databases 
  such as PostGIS and Oracle Spatial.

* **Tile Your Data** - Ideally, your data will be 'sliced up' into pieces 
  about the size in which it will be displayed.  There is unnecessary overhead 
  to searching through a large shapefile or image of which you are only going 
  to display a small area.  By breaking the data up into tiles and creating a 
  tile index, MapServer only needs to open up and search the data files of 
  interest.  Shapefile data can be broken into smaller tiles and then a 
  tileindex shapefile can be created using 
  `tile4ms <http://mapserver.gis.umn.edu/utils.html>`__.  A shapefile tileindex 
  for raster files can be created using 
  `gdaltindex <http://www.remotesensing.org/gdal/gdal_utilities.html#gdaltindex>`__.
          
* **Pre-Classify Your Data** - MapServer allows for the use of quite 
  complex `EXPRESSIONs <http://ms.gis.umn.edu/docs/reference/mapfile/class>`__ 
  to classify data. However, using logical and regular expressions is more 
  resource intensive than string comparisons.  To increase efficiency, you 
  can divide your data into classes ahead of time, create a field to use as 
  the CLASSITEM and populate it with a simple value that identifies the class, 
  such as 1,2,3, or 4 for a four class data set.  You can then do a simple 
  string comparison for the class EXPRESSION.

* **Pre-Process Your Images** - Do resource intensive processing up front.  
  See the `Raster HowTo <http://ms.gis.umn.edu/docs/howto/raster_data/#preprocessing>`__

* **Generalize for Overview** - create a more simple, generalized data layer 
  to display at small scales, and then use scale-dependent layers utilizing 
  `LAYER <http://ms.gis.umn.edu/docs/reference/mapfile/layer>`__ MINSCALE and 
  LAYER MAXSCALE to show more detailed data layers as the user zooms in.  
  This same concept applies to images.
