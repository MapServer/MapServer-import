- Symbol definitions can be included within the main MapFile or, more 
  commonly, in a separate file. Symbol definitions in a separate file 
  are designated using the SYMBOLSET keyword, as part of the :ref`MAP Object <map>`. 
  This recommended setup is ideal for re-using symbol definitions across 
  multiple MapServer applications.
- There are 3 main types of symbols in MapServer: Markers, 
  Shadesets, and Lines.
- Symbol 0 is always the degenerate case for a particular class of 
  symbol. For points, symbol 0 is a single pixel, for shading (i.e. 
  filled polygons) symbol 0 is a solid fill, and for lines, symbol 0 
  is a single pixel wide line.
- Symbol definitions contain no color information, colors are set within 
  :ref:`CLASS` objects.
- For MapServer versions < 5 there is a maximum of 64 symbols per file. This can
  be changed by editing mapsymbol.h and changing the value of MS_MAXSYMBOLS at the 
  top of the file.  As of MapServer 5.0 there is no symbol limit.
- More information can be found in the :ref:`Construction of Cartographic Symbols <sym_construction>`
  document.
