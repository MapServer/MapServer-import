ANGLE [double]
   Angle, given in degrees, to rotate the map. Default is 0. The rendered map will rotate in a clockwise direction. The following are important notes:

   - Requires a PROJECTION object specified at the MAP level and for each LAYER object (even if all layers are in the same projection). 

   - Requires MapScript (SWIG, PHPMapscript). Does not work with CGI mode. 

   - If using the LABEL object's ANGLE or the LAYER object's LABELANGLEITEM parameters as well, these parameters are relative to the map's orientation (i.e. they are computed after the MAP object's ANGLE). For example, if you have specified an ANGLE for the map of 45, and then have a layer LABELANGLEITEM value of 45, the resulting label will not appear rotated (because the resulting map is rotated clockwise 45 degrees and the label is rotated counter-clockwise 45 degrees). 

   - More information can be found on the MapRotation `Wiki Page`_.

CONFIG [key] [value]
    This can be used to define the location of your EPSG files for the PROJ.4 
    library. Setting the [key] to PROJ_LIB and the [value] to the location of 
    your EPSG files will force PROJ.4 to use this value. Using CONFIG allows 
    you to avoid setting environment variables to point to your PROJ_LIB 
    directory. Here are some examples:

    1. Unix
       ::

         CONFIG "PROJ_LIB" "/usr/local/share/proj/"
    2. Windows
       ::

         CONFIG "PROJ_LIB" "C:/somedir/proj/nad/"

    Any other value will be passed on to CPLSetConfigOption(). This provides 
    customized control of some GDAL and OGR driver behaviours. Details on 
    such options would be found in specific GDAL driver documentation.

.. _DATAPATTERN:

DATAPATTERN [regular expression]
    This defines a regular expression to be applied to requests to change DATA 
    parameters via URL requests (i.e. map_layername_data=...). If a pattern 
    doesn't exist then web users can't monkey with support files via URLs. 
    This allows you to isolate one application from another if you desire, 
    with the default operation being very conservative. See also 
    TEMPLATEPATTERN_.

DEBUG [on|off]
    Enables debugging of the map object. Verbose output is generated and sent 
    to the standard error output (STDERR) or the MapServer logfile if one is 
    set using the LOG parameter in the WEB object.  Apache users will see timing
    details for drawing in Apache's error_log file.

    Requires MapServer to be built with the DEBUG=MSDEBUG option (--with-debug 
    configure option).

EXTENT [minx] [miny] [maxx] [maxy]
    The spatial extent of the map to be created. In most cases you will need 
    to specify this, although mapserver can sometimes (expensively) 
    calculate one if it is not specified.

FONTSET [filename]
    Filename of fontset file to use.  Can be a path relative to the mapfile, or a full path.

IMAGECOLOR [r] [g] [b]
    Color to initialize the map with (i.e. background color). When 
    transparency is enabled (TRANSPARENT ON) for the typical case of 8-bit 
    pseudocolored map generation, this color will be marked as transparent 
    in the output file palette. Any other map components drawn in this color 
    will also be transparenct, so for map generation with transparency it is 
    best to use an otherwise unused color as the background color.

IMAGEQUALITY [int]
    *Deprecated* Use FORMATOPTION "QUALITY=n" in the OUTPUTFORMAT declaration 
    to specify compression quality for JPEG output.

IMAGETYPE [gif|png|jpeg|wbmp|gtiff|swf|userdefined]
    Output format to generate. See details in the `OUTPUTFORMAT`_ section for 
    available formats. The name here must match the 'NAME' of a user defined 
    or internally generated OUTPUTFORMAT section.

.. _`OUTPUTFORMAT`: /docs/reference/mapfile/outputformat

INTERLACE [on|off]
    *Deprecated* Use FORMATOPTION "INTERLACE=ON" in the `OUTPUTFORMAT`_ 
    declaration to specify if the output images should be interlaced.

LAYER
    Signals the start of a `LAYER`_ object.

.. _`LAYER`: /docs/reference/mapfile/layer

LEGEND
    Signals the start of a `LEGEND`_ object.

.. _`LEGEND`: /docs/reference/mapfile/legend

MAXSIZE [integer]
    Sets the maximum size of the map image. This will override the default value. For example, setting this to 2048 means that you can have up to 2048 pixels in both dimensions (i.e. max of 2048x2048). 

NAME [name]
    Prefix attached to map, scalebar and legend GIF filenames created using 
    this MapFile. It should be kept short.

PROJECTION
    Signals the start of a `PROJECTION`_ object.

.. _`PROJECTION`: /docs/reference/mapfile/projection

QUERYMAP
    Signals the start of a `QUERYMAP`_ object.

.. _`QUERYMAP`: /docs/reference/mapfile/querymap

REFERENCE
    Signals the start of a `REFERENCE MAP`_ object.

.. _`REFERENCE MAP`: /docs/reference/mapfile/reference

RESOLUTION [int]
    Sets the pixels per inch for output, only affects scale computations 
    and nothing else, default is 72.

SCALE [double]
    Computed scale of the map. Set most often by the application.

SCALEBAR
    Signals the start of a `SCALEBAR`_ object.

.. _`SCALEBAR`: /docs/reference/mapfile/scalebar

SHAPEPATH [filename]
    Path to the directory holding the shapefiles or tiles. There can be 
    further subdirectories under SHAPEPATH.

SIZE [x][y]
    Size in pixels of the output image (i.e. the map).

STATUS [on|off]
    Is the map active? Sometimes you may wish to turn this off to use only the 
    reference map or scale bar.

SYMBOLSET [filename]
    Filename of the symbolset to use.  Can be a path relative to the mapfile, or a full path.

SYMBOL
    Signals the start of a `SYMBOL`_ object.

.. _`SYMBOL`: /docs/reference/symbology

.. _TEMPLATEPATTERN:

TEMPLATEPATTERN [regular expression]
    This defines a regular expression to be applied to requests to change 
    TEMPLATE parameters via URL requests (i.e. map_layername_template=...). If 
    a pattern doesn't exist then web users can't monkey with support files via 
    URLs. This allows you to isolate one application from another if you 
    desire, with the default operation being very conservative. See also 
    DATAPATTERN_.

TRANSPARENT [on|off]
    *Deprecated* Use FORMATOPTION "TRANSPARENT=ON" in the OUTPUTFORMAT 
    declaration to specify if the output images should be transparent.

UNITS [feet|inches|kilometers|meters|miles|dd]
    Units of the map coordinates. Used for scalebar and scale computations.

WEB
    Signals the start of a `WEB`_ object.
