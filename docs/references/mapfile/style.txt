This object is new in 4.0 and is intended to seperate logic from looks. The final intent is to have named styles (Not yet supported) that will be re-usable through the mapfile. This is the new, preferred way of defining the appearance of an object, notably a class.

-----------

ANGLE [double]
    Angle, given in degrees, to draw the line work. Default is 0. For symbols of Type HATCH, this is the angle of the hatched lines. For its use with hatched lines, see Example#8 in the `SYMBOL examples`_.

.. _`SYMBOL examples`: /docs/reference/symbology/examples

ANGLEITEM [string]
    Attribute/field that stores the angle to be used in rendering. Angle is given in degrees with 0 meaning no rotation.

ANTIALIAS [true|false]
    Should TrueType fonts and Cartoline symbols be antialiased.

BACKGROUNDCOLOR [r] [g] [b]
    Color to use for non-transparent symbols.

COLOR [r] [g] [b]
    Color to use for drawing features.

MAXSIZE [integer]
    Maximum size in pixels to draw a symbol. Default is 50.

MINSIZE [integer]
    Minimum size in pixels to draw a symbol. Default is 0.

MINWIDTH [integer]
    Minimum width in pixels to draw the line work.

OFFSET [x][y]
    Offset values for shadows, hollow symbols, etc ...
  
OUTLINECOLOR [r] [g] [b]
    Color to use for outlining polygons and certain marker symbols. Line 
    symbols do not support outline colors.

SIZE [integer]
    Height, in pixels, of the symbol/pattern to be used. Only useful with 
    scalable symbols. Default is 1. For symbols of Type HATCH, the SIZE is the distance between hatched lines. For its use with hatched lines, see Example#8 in the `SYMBOL examples`_.

SIZEITEM [string]
    Attribute/field that stores the size to be used in rendering. Value is given in pixels.

SYMBOL [integer|string|filename]
    The symbol name or number to use for all features if attribute tables are 
    not used. The number is the index of the symbol in the symbol file, 
    starting at 1, the 5th symbol in the file is therefore symbol number 5. 
    You can also give your symbols names using the NAME keyword in the symbol 
    definition file, and use those to refer to them. Default is 0, which 
    results in a single pixel, single width line, or solid polygon fill, 
    depending on layer type.

    You can also specify a gif or png filename. The path is relative to the 
    location of the mapfile. 

WIDTH [integer]
    Width refers to the thickness of line work drawn, in pixels. Default is 1. For symbols of Type HATCH, the WIDTH is how thick the hatched lines are. For its use with hatched lines, see Example#8 in the `SYMBOL examples`_.
