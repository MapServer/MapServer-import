BACKGROUNDCOLOR [r] [g] [b]
    Color to use for non-transparent symbols.
  
COLOR [r] [g] [b]
    Color to use for drawing features.

DEBUG [on|off]
    Enables debugging of the class object. Verbose output is generated and sent 
    to the standard error output (STDERR) or the MapServe r logfile if one is 
    set using the LOG parameter in the `WEB`_ object.

EXPRESSION [string]
    Four types of expressions are now supported to define class membership. 
    String comparisons, regular expressions, simple logical expressions, and 
    string functions. If no expression is given, then all features are said 
    to belong to this class.

    - String comparisons are case sensitive and are the fastest to evaluate. 
      No special delimiters are necessary although string must be quoted if they 
      contain special characters. (As a matter of good habit, it is recommended 
      you quote all strings).
      
    - Regular expressions function just like previous versions of MapServer. 
      However, you must now delimit a regular expression using /regex/. No 
      quotes should be used.

    - Logical expressions allow you to build fairly complex tests based on one 
      or more attributes and therefore are only available with shapefiles. 
      Logical expressions are delimited by parentheses "(expression)". 
      Attribute names are delimited by square brackets "[ATTRIBUTE]". These 
      names are case sensitive and must match the items in the shapefile. 
      For example: EXPRESSION ([POPULATION] > 50000 AND '[LANGUAGE]' eq 
      'FRENCH') ... The following logical operators are supported: 
      =,>,<,<=,>=,=,or,and,lt,gt,ge,le,eq,ne. As you might expect this level 
      of complexity is slower to process.

    - One string function exists: length(). This obviously computes the length 
      of a string. An example follows:

      ::
        
         EXPRESSION (length('[NAME_E]') < 8)                      
                                
      String comparisons and regular expressions work from the classitem defined 
      at the layer level. You may mix expression types within the different 
      classes of a layer.

GROUP [string]
    Allows for grouping of classes. It is only used when a CLASSGROUP at the
    `LAYER`_ level is set. If the CLASSGROUP parameter is set, only classes that
    have the same group name would be considered at rendering time.  An example
    of a layer with grouped classes might contain:

    ::

      LAYER
        ...
        CLASSGROUP "group1"
        ...
        CLASS
          NAME "name1"
          GROUP "group1"
          ...
        END
        CLASS
          NAME "name2"
          GROUP "group2"
          ...
        END
        CLASS
          NAME "name3"
          GROUP "group1"
          ...
        END
        ...
      END # layer

KEYIMAGE [filename]
    Full filename of the legend image for the CLASS. This image is used when 
    building a legend (or requesting a legend icon via MapScript or the CGI 
    application).
    
LABEL
    Signals the start of a `LABEL`_ object.

.. _`LABEL`: /docs/reference/mapfile/label
    
MAXSCALEDENOM [double]
    Maximum scale at which this CLASS is drawn.  Scale is given as the
    denominator of the actual scale fraction, for example for a map at a scale
    of 1:24,000 use 24000.  Implemented in MapServer 5.0, to replace the
    deprecated MAXSCALE parameter.

MAXSCALE [double] - deprecated
    Since MapServer 5.0 the proper parameter to use is MAXSCALEDENOM instead.
    The deprecated MAXSCALE is the maximum scale at which this CLASS is drawn.
    Scale is given as the denominator of the actual scale fraction, for example
    for a map at a scale of 1:24,000 use 24000.
    
MAXSIZE [integer]
    Maximum size in pixels to draw a symbol. Default is 50.
    
MINSCALEDENOM [double]
    Minimum scale at which this CLASS is drawn.  Scale is given as the
    denominator of the actual scale fraction, for example for a map at a scale
    of 1:24,000 use 24000.  Implemented in MapServer 5.0, to replace the
    deprecated MINSCALE parameter.

MINSCALE [double] - deprecated
    Since MapServer 5.0 the proper parameter to use is MINSCALEDENOM
    instead.  The deprecated MINSCALE is the minimum scale at which this CLASS
    is drawn.  Scale is given as the denominator of the actual scale fraction,
    for example for a map at a scale of 1:24,000 use 24000.
    
MINSIZE [integer]
    Minimum size in pixels to draw a symbol. Default is 0.
    
NAME [string]
    Name to use in legends for this class. If not set class won't show up in legend.
    
OUTLINECOLOR [r] [g] [b]
    Color to use for outlining polygons and certain marker symbols. Line symbols 
    do not support outline colors.
    
SIZE [integer]
    Height, in pixels, of the symbol/pattern to be used. Only useful with scalable 
    symbols. For vector (and ellipse) symbol types the default size is based on the 
    range of Y values in the POINTS defining the symbol. For pixmaps, the default 
    is the vertical size of the image. Default size is 1 for TTF symbols. 
    
STATUS [on|off]
    Sets the current display status of the class.  Default turns the class on.

STYLE
    Signals the start of a `STYLE`_ object. A class can contain multiple styles.
    
.. _`STYLE`: /docs/reference/mapfile/style

SYMBOL [integer|string|filename]
    The symbol name or number to use for all features if attribute tables are 
    not used. The number is the index of the symbol in the symbol file, starting 
    at 1, the 5th symbol in the file is therefore symbol number 5. You can also 
    give your symbols names using the NAME keyword in the symbol definition file, 
    and use those to refer to them. Default is 0, which results in a single pixel, 
    single width line, or solid polygon fill, depending on layer type.

    You can also specify a gif or png filename. The path is relative to the location 
    of the mapfile.
    
TEMPLATE [filename]
    Template file or URL to use in presenting query results to the user.
    
TEXT [string]
    Static text to label features in this class with. This overrides values obtained 
    from the LABELTIEM. The string may be given as an expression delimited using 
    the ()'s. This allows you to concatenate multiple attributes into a single 
    label. For example: ([FIRSTNAME],[LASTNAME]).

You can also "stack" 2 symbols to achieve interesting effects. You define the second 
symbol, which effectively sits "on top" of the symbol normally defined above.

The following parameters allow you to define the symbol, and they are equivalent 
to their non-overlay counterparts:

- OVERLAYBACKGROUNDCOLOR
- OVERLAYCOLOR
- OVERLAYOUTLINECOLOR
- OVERLAYSIZE
- OVERLAYMINSIZE
- OVERLAYMAXSIZE
- OVERLAYSYMBOL
