What is vector data?  This quote from is a good description of what vector data is:

	Vector: "An abstraction of the real world where positional data is 
	represented in the form of coordinates.  In vector data, the basic units 
	of spatial information are points, lines and polygons.  Each of these 
	units is composed simply as a series of one or more coordinate points.  
	For example, a line is a collection of related points, and a polygon is a 
	collection of related lines.  Vector images are defined mathematically as a 
	series of points joined by lines.  Vector-based drawings are resolution 
	independent.  This means that they appear at the maximum resolution of the 
	output device, such as a printer or monitor.  Each object is self-contained,
	with properties such as color, shape, outline, size, and position on the 
	screen."

MapServer can access vector file formats and database connections.  It can also
access raster or image data.  This is a summary of the vector and database 
formats with particular focus on how to use them in a MapServer map file and 
access them using command line tools like **ogrinfo**.

MapServer and vector data access
------------------------------------

MapServer has two main methods for accessing data:

*  Through built-in, format-specific, data access capabilities.

		The most basic form of data access uses the built-in capabilities that 
		were linked into MapServer when it was compiled.  These capabilities are
		limited to only a few types of vector data, such as ESRI Shapefile,
		PostGIS, Oracle Spatial and ArcSDE.  The default, built-in, format for 
		MapServer is the ESRI Shapefile format.

*	Using the capabilities of third-party data access libraries.

		One of the most powerful features of MapServer is the ability to use data 		formats through a pseudo plug-in environment.  The most significant third
		party library being used is GDAL/OGR.  This includes raster (GDAL) and 
		vector (OGR) data.

Using OGR
------------------------------------

OGR is used behind the scenes by MapServer when requested.  MapServer does not 
require OGR in order to run.  Some users may never need the additional 
capabilities OGR offers, but many users find them absolutely necessary.  Because 
MapServer is capable of accessing data via OGR, there is less need to program 
specific types of data format support directly into MapServer.  Instead, further 
additions can be made to OGR and then be used by MapServer.  In essence, the 
background libraries allow MapServer to bring the data into an internal, 
memory-based format that MapServer can use.  For the most part, using 
OGR-related formats is seamless and intuitive.
