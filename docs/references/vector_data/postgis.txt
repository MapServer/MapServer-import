PostGIS is supported directly by MapServer and must be compiled into MapServer to work.

In most cases, PostgreSQL and PostGIS libraries (.dll or .so) must be present in the system's path environment for functionality to be present.  This includes the libpq and libpostgis libraries.

Map File Example
Specify::
	
	CONNECTIONTYPE POSTGIS

Specify::

	CONNECTION "host=yourhostname dbname=yourdatabasename user=yourdbusername password=yourdbpassword port=yourpgport"

CONNECTION  parameters can be in any order.  Most are optional.  dbname is 
required.  host defaults to localhost, port defaults to 5432 - the standard 
port for PostgreSQL.

Specify::
	
	DATA "geometrycolumn from yourtablename".  

MapServer had a bug related to the keyword from.  Specify it in lower case 
to avoid problems.  Geometrycolumn could be the_geom if the shp2pgsql 
utility is used to load data, or wkb_geometry if ogr2ogr was used.

Complete Mapfile example::

  LAYER
    NAME pg_test
    STATUS ON
    TYPE POLYGON
    CONNECTIONTYPE POSTGIS
    CONNECTION "host=mapserver.com dbname=gmap user=julio"
    DATA "wkb_geometry FROM province"
    CLASS
       ...
    END
  END
