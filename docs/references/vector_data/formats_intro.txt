The rest of this document is the data format guide.  This guide is structured to
show the fundamentals of each MapServer supported data format.  Each section 
discusses one format, ranging from one to several pages in length.  The sections 
typically start with a summary of the most important information about the 
format, followed by examples of file listings, connection methods, ogrinfo usage 
and MapServer map file syntax examples.

Each section has been designed to stand alone, so you may notice that certain 
warnings and comments are repeated or redundant.  This is intentional.  Each 
format is presented in rough order of popular use, based on a survey of the 
MapServer community.

The following formats are included:

* ESRI Shapefiles (SHP)
* PostGIS / PostgreSQL Database
* MapInfo Files (TAB/MID/MIF)
* Oracle Spatial Database
* Web Feature Service (WFS)
* Geography Markup Language (GML)
* Virtual Spatial Data (ODBC/OVF)
* TIGER Files
* ESRI Binary Coverages (ADF)
* ESRI ArcSDE (SDE)
* Microstation Design Files (DGN)
* IHO S-57 Files
* Spatial Data Transfer Standard (SDTS)
* Inline MapServer Features
* National Transfer Format (NTF)
* Mysql MYGIS Format

	MySQL spatial database is only partially covered in this guide at this time due to 
	lack of familiarity by the authors.  Future contributions by MySQL users 
	are welcome in this guide.
