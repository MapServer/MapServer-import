MS RFC 48: GEOTRANSFORM Geometry operations
======================================================================

:Status: Draft
:Version: MapServer 5.4


Summary
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The purpose of this RFC is to add the ability to Mapserver to interpret the
geometries based on a user-defined GEOMETRYTRANSFORM keyword, and to render
the interpreted geometry with the selected styling

An example usage would be:

::

    GEOMETRYTRANSFORM "centroid(geom)"

to treat the underlying geometry as a point rendered at the centroid of
current feature.

The directive to activate this behavior is the GEOMETRYTRANSFORM keyword, that
initially belongs to the STYLE object. Further developments could be to enable
the keyword at the LAYER level.

Usages of this parameter include drawing bounding boxes of underlying
geometries, or adding arrowheads/tails to lines.

Further developments would allow complex expressions to be passed to the
keyword, allowing nested transformations to the underlying geometry, eg:

::

    GEOMETRYTRANSFORM "difference(geom,buffer(geom,10))"

and binding to attributes, eg:

::

    GEOMETRYTRANSFORM "buffer(geom,[distance])"

Detailed functionality
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The GEOMETRYTRANSFORM keyword initially accepts these parameters :

- *bbox(geom)* : render a shapeObj representing the bounding box of the 
  underlying geometry
- *buffer(geom,distance)* : render a shapeObj representing the buffered geometry.
  "distance" specifies the buffer distance, in layer units. Not initially implemented.
- *centroid(geom)* : render a pointObj at the location of the centroid of the
  geometry
- *convexhull(geom)* : not initially implemented
- *start/end(the_geom)* : render a point symbol at the first/last vertex of the
  underlying geometry. By default, the symbol is oriented to match the 
  orientation of the corresponding geometry segment. This would be used
  to add arrowheads/tails to linestrings.
- *vertices(geom[,option]* : render a point symbol at each vertex of the geometry.
  The default orientation matches the half angle of the corresponding segments. 
  The option keyword, specifies if the start and or end vertices should also be 
  included in the transformation.

Implementation Details
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Apart from the parsing and internal storage of which type should be used,
the modifications of this RFC only affect the high-level rendering functions
in mapdraw.c .

There are two main modifications:

- inside msDrawVectorLayer, a copy of the shape before being clipped by the
  current extent must be kept, as the whole shape must be used for all but
  the VERTICES type. Then, when looping through the different styles that 
  can be applied, we switch off to the type-specific function if a GEOMETRYTRANSFORM 
  keyword is set.
- inside mapdraw.c, the type-specific drawing function is added. Depending
  on the current style type, it either computes a new shape from the
  original shape (types bbox, convexhull or buffer) and passes it to the
  msDrawShadeSymbol, or calls msDrawMarkerSymbol for points of the original
  shape (types start, end, vertices, centroid) after having adjusted the
  orientation accordingly.

Affected Files
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- mapdraw.c
- maplexer.c/.l
- mapfile.c
- mapserver.h
- one or more files may be added for the parsing of the transform expression, and
  the transformation itself.

MapScript implications
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Getters and setters will have to be added to the different mapscripts.

A possible enhancement could also be to expose the transformation function to
MapScript.

Documentation
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TBD post implementation

Backwards Incompatibility Issues
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

none expected.
