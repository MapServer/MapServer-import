  MS RFC 41: Support of WCS 1.1.x Protocol
=========================================================

:Status: Adopted

Overview
--------

It is proposed to extend MapServer to support the WCS 1.1 protocol. MapServer
already supports the WCS 1.0 protocol, but WCS 1.1 is significantly different.


Implementation Methodology
--------------------------

WCS 1.1 is closed based on OWS Common metadata (unlike WCS 1.0), and
implementation of the WCS service will take advantage of the OWS metadata
services in mapowscommon.c. However, mapowscommon.c is based on libxml for xml
serialization (unlike the printf() based WCS 1.0 service). For this reason,
WCS 1.1 GetCapabilities and DescribeCoverage implementations will be largely
separate from WCS 1.0 implementations and will be implemented using libxml.

It should be noted that the format and organization of the WCS 1.1
capabilities and coverage description methods are so different that separate
implementations would have been pretty much necessary anyways.

The key entry points in mapwcs.c for WCS services will be updated to "call
out" to WCS 1.1 versions of the services in mapwcs11.c.

It is anticipated that the bulk of the WCS 1.0 GetCoverage implementation will
be shared with WCS 1.1 with special WCS 1.1 implementations to handle specific
issues in the request (RangeSet processing, and multi-part mime return results
for instance).


WCS 1.1 Protocol Limitations
----------------------------

- Only one <Field> may be associated with the Range of Coverage when 
  served through MapServer.
- Only two types of Axis will be supported, a "Bands" axis, 
  and a "Time" axis. 


Metadata Mapping
----------------

The current WCS metadata items are tightly related to the WCS 1.0 protocol,
while the WCS 1.1 protocol used a substantially different form and conventions
for service, and coverage descriptions as well as for the getcoverage request.
The following table indicates which WCS metadata items are mapped to what
coverage XML elements in WCS 1.0 and WCS 1.1::

 <x>_bands_name              Axis.identifier          AxisDescription.name


URNs / Coordinate Systems and Axis Orientation
----------------------------------------------

WCS 1.1 uses URNs like "urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::4326" or 
"urn:ogc:def:crs:OGC::CRS84".  In addition the WCS protocol is required to 
honour EPSG axis conventions when using coordinate systems within the EPSG
authority space.  This means, for instance, that any coordinates in
the urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::4326 coordinate system must be provided in lat,long
ordering instead of the conventional long,lat.  

In order to implement these requirements, several changes are planned:

- msLoadProjectionString() will be updated to expand URNs in the 
  EPSG and OGC name spaces.  
- msLoadProjectionString() will add the "+epsgaxis=ne" parameter for URNs for
  GCS codes in the EPSG name space. 
- New msAxisNormalizePoints() and msAxisDenormalizePoints() will be added for
  converting between normalized (easting,northing) axis orientation and
  EPSG preferred (denormalized) axis orientation (sometimes northing,easting).
  These functions will scan the p->args[] list for the +epsgaxis=ne to decide.
- msOWSCommonBoundingBox() will be modified to use these axis denormalization
  function to denormalize axis ordering for EPSG GCS URNs. 
- the WCS 1.1 GetCoverage call will use msAxisNormalizePoints() to fix up 
  orientation of request axes when needed.

MapScript
---------

No changes to MapScript are anticipated. 


Backwards Compatibility
-----------------------

No alterations to WCS 1.0 support are expected, and it is not expected that
the mechanisms for specifying services metadata will be changed though it is
possible a few metadata items used only in WCS 1.1 will be added.

Documentation
-------------

The :ref:`wcs_server` will be extended to discuss WCS 1.1 related issues. 

Implementation Resources
------------------------

Implementation will be done by Frank Warmerdam with financial support from
Noetix Research Inc. and the Geoconnections program of the Canadian
Government. Preliminary implementation is already operational in svn trunk,
and work completion is anticipated by March 1st.

Testing
-------

Tests will be added to msautotest/wxs for the WCS 1.1 protocol. Additional
assistance with WCS 1.1 validation from other contributors would be welcome.


Bug ID
------

None Yet.
