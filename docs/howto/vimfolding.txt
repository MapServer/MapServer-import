Introduction
------------

`Vim code folding <http://www.vim.org/htmldoc/usr_28.html>`__ can be an extremely handy way to simplify the task of editing complex MapServer mapfiles inside the Vim editor. A Vim command file called **map_fold.vim** is attached to this document, which defines a folding mode for mapfiles. This file also lives at http://iconocla.st/code/dot/map_fold.vim.

Installation
------------

Global installation of new Vim filetypes is described in the `Vim syntax howto <http://mapserver.gis.umn.edu/docs/howto/vim-syntax-howto>`__. In Vim 6, you can copy *map_fold.vim* as-is to your *$VIMROOT/ftplugin/* directory, and it should more or less work.

To use locally, create a *~/.vim/ftplugin* directory, copy *map_fold.vim* to it, and then add the following to your *~/.vimrc*:

::

  autocmd BufRead *.map set filetype=map

*map_fold.vim* is totally compatible with the *map.vim* `syntax highlighter <http://mapserver.gis.umn.edu/docs/howto/vim-syntax-howto>`__, and their combined use is even recommended.

Use
---

The Vim `folding tutorial <http://www.vim.org/htmldoc/usr_28.html>`__ (at least the first two or three sections) is highly recommended. The Vim `folding reference <http://www.vim.org/htmldoc/fold.html>`__ may also be helpful.
