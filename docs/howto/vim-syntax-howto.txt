General remarks
===============

vi (vim) resides in: /usr/share/vim/current (vim_root).

Syntax definitions are in vim_root/syntax/\*.vim files. Linking file types to extensions is done in vim_root/ftdetect/\*.vim. (The the star denotes 
the extension and would be replaced with map to define highlighting of Mapserver config files).



Installation
============

The installation process requires two steps:

1. Copy the `map.vim`_ syntax file to the syntax directory

   Copy map.vim to the vim syntax directory (on Suse: /usr/share/vim/current/syntax)

2. Register the syntax file in the custom filetype directory

   If absent, create a new directory called ftdetect in vim_root (on Suse Linux: /usr/share/vim/current).
   Create a new file called map.vim in ftdetect according to the example shown below:

   ::

     " Mapserver config file
     au BufNewFile,BufRead *.map         setf map

Now restart vim and open a map file ....

Closing Remarks
===============

The keywords are based on the TextPad Symbol Map_40.syn file contributed by Christopher 
Thorne, which can also be found on the Mapserver utility page.  I hope the file is 
somehow useful to anybody out there. If there are any questions or suggestions, 
please feel free to contact me.
