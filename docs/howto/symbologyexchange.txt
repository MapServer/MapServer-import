<h2>The Symbology Exchange</h2><p>Making a two-color square is easy, but a two-color star looks crummy unless you have the sizes just right -- it took me hours to make up a set of icons at 6 sizes apiece. And I knew I wasn't alone. So welcome to the Symbology Exchange!</p><p><br />Please post a comment to the appropriate "sub-howto" showing your icon(s). Ideally, there would be the code for it in a code box (the style selector at the top, highlight it and select Literal) and maybe even an image to show what it looks like. Thanks for sharing, and we hope you find something you like!</p><br /><ul><li><a href="/docs/howto/symbologyexchange_pixmap">Pixmap (image) symbols</a></li><li><a href="/docs/howto/symbologyexchange_vector">Vector symbols</a></li><li><a href="/docs/howtos/symbologyexchange_ttf">TrueType Font (TTF) Symbols</a><br /></li></ul><br /><p><br /></p><h2>Other Documents of Interest</h2><ul><li><a href="/docs/reference/mapfile/style">Mapfile reference: Style object</a> -- The most basic documentation about how to use symbols.</li><li><a href="/docs/reference/symbology">Symbology</a> -- A manual about symbology and how it works.
