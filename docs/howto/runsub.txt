<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Run-time substitution for the MapServer CGI has been around since version 4.0 and it's use has continued to expand. In short, it allows you to alter portions of a mapfile based on data passed via a CGI request. This functionality is only available via the standard CGI application. Within MapScript this is easy to do since the developer has complete control over how input is handled.
</p>

<h2>Basic Example</h2>
<p>
Let's say you'd like the user to dynamically set a portion of an expression so they could highlight a certain land cover class, and you have a form element (called ctype) that allows them to choose between: forest, water, wetland and developed. You could then set up a layer like so:
</p>

<pre>
LAYER
  NAME 'covertypes'
  ...
  CLASSITEM 'type'
  CLASS # highlighted presentation
    EXPRESSION '%ctype%'
    ...
  END
  CLASS # default presentation
    ...
  END
END
</pre>

<p>
When a request is processed the value for ctype is substituted for the string %ctype% and the mapfile is processed as normal. If no ctype is passed in the EXPRESSION will never be true so it doesn't really hurt anything except fot a slight performance hit. Often you would set a default class to draw features that don't match, but that is not required.
</p>

<h2>Parameters Supported</h2>

<p>
Not every mapfile parameter supports run-time substitution and care has been taken to try and support those that make the most sense. Remember, you also can do run-time configuration using the map_object_property type syntax detailed elsewhere (todo- add link). Below is a list of properties that do allow run-time substitution (todo- add MapServer version):
</p>

<p><ul>
<li> LAYER: DATA (must validate against DATAPATTERN)
<li> LAYER: TILEINDEX
<li> LAYER: CONNECTION
<li> LAYER: FILTER
<li> CLASS EXPRESSION
</ul></p>
