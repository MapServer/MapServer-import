If you have a symbol to share, or want to share the URL of a symbolfile, please post it as a comment.<p><br /></p><p>Guidelines:<br /></p><ul><li>Please post a description of your symbols. While "railroad" is useful, it doesn't indicate how your railroad symbol differs from anyone else's. Is it just different? Does it handle antialiasing and transparency at the same time? Does it look good at a wide variety of sizes?<br /></li><li>If you're able to post a link to seeing the symbol in action, be it a static image or its usage in a real map, that would be ideal.</li></ul><br /><br />
