If you have a symbol to share, or want to share the URL of a cartographic icon or set of icons, please post it as a comment.

<p>Guidelines:<br />
</p>
<ul><li>Please post a description of your symbols. "Various symbols" is nice, but if you can list what they are or at least say whether there's a focus, that would be great.<br />
  </li><li>If you're able to post a link to seeing the symbol in action, be
it a static image or its usage in a real map, that would be ideal.</li></ul>
