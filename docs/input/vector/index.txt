What is vector data?  This quote from is a good description of what vector data is:

.. pull-quote::
	Vector: "An abstraction of the real world where positional data is 
	represented in the form of coordinates.  In vector data, the basic units 
	of spatial information are points, lines and polygons.  Each of these 
	units is composed simply as a series of one or more coordinate points.  
	For example, a line is a collection of related points, and a polygon is a 
	collection of related lines.  Vector images are defined mathematically as a 
	series of points joined by lines.  Vector-based drawings are resolution 
	independent.  This means that they appear at the maximum resolution of the 
	output device, such as a printer or monitor.  Each object is self-contained,
	with properties such as color, shape, outline, size, and position on the 
	screen."
