Description: This RFC proposes a generic implementation for rendering
the feature styles retrieved from the various data sources. In this
regard we intend to enhance the existing STYLEITEM option
which could now be specified for all layer types and not restricted
to the OGR driver.

Background
~~~~~~~~~~

Currently only the OGR driver supports rendering the styles attached
to a feature in the OGR data sources. Theoretically only a few data
sources support storing the styles along with the features
(like MapInfo, AutoCAD DXF, Microstation DGN), however those styles 
can easily be transferred to many other data sources as a separate attribute 
by using the ogr2ogr SQL option as follows:

::

   ogr2ogr -sql "select *, OGR_STYLE from srclayer" "dstlayer" "srclayer"


As a result of the transfer, the OGR style string is added to the 
destination layer as a separate attribute. We could also rename this
attribute during the transfer according to the following example:

::

  ogr2ogr -sql "select *, OGR_STYLE as mystyleattribute from srclayer" "dstlayer" "srclayer"


Currently the style string transferred this way can only be rendered by
the MapServer OGR driver, however it would be reasonable to implement such
option for all layer types in MapServer.

Proposed New Syntax
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This RFC wouldn't alter the current behaviour of STYLEITEM "AUTO" option, which causes
the driver specific LayerGetAutoStyle vtable method to be called as before.
If LayerGetAutoStyle is not implemented by a driver an error message is
provided to the user "'STYLEITEM AUTO' not supported for this data source."

We will however add support for specifying the feature attribute containing
the style string in the form: STYLEITEM "mystyleattribute" which
will tell mapserver to initialize the style from the specified attribute in
a generic way.

Supported Style Representations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We will implement support for either the current mapserver and OGR specific
style representations. 

The mapserver style representation follows the syntax of the STYLE and CLASS 
entries in the mapfile format like the following sample:

::

  "STYLE BACKGROUNDCOLOR 128 0 0 COLOR 0 0 208 END"
  
By specifying the entire CLASS instead of a single style allows to use further options
(like setting expressions, label attributes, multiple styles) on a per feature basis.

In addition to the mapserver style the OGR style string format will also be supported
as described in the following documentation: http://www.gdal.org/ogr/ogr_feature_style.html

The actual style format will be identifyed at run-time according to the first characters of the
style strings. This solution will allow to specify multiple style formats within the same layer.


Implementation Details
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to implement this enhancement the following changes should be
made in the MapServer codebase:

1) Modify msDrawVectorLayer (in mapdraw.cpp) to invoke a new method (msLayerGetFeatureStyle) 
   when STYLEITEM is set for a particular layer.
   
2) Implement msLayerGetFeatureStyle in maplayer.c which will call either msUpdateStyleFromString,
   msUpdateClassFromString or the new method: msOGRUpdateStyleFromString according to
   the actual style format retrieved from the layer.

3) Modify msOGRLayerGetAutoStyle (in mapogr.cpp) and extract the bulk of the style
   initialization into a separate function (msOGRUpdateStyle). We will add a new function 
   (msOGRUpdateStyleFromString) where the style manager will be initialized by using 
   OGRStyleMgr::InitStyleString instead of OGRStyleMgr::InitFromFeature
   
4) Modify msLayerWhichItems in (maplayer.c) to retrieve the attribute containing the style string
   specified in the STYLEITEM parameter. By using STYLEITEM "AUTO" no additional attribute 
   will be retrieved just as before.

MapScript Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There's no need to modify the MapScript interface since the styleitem parameter has
already been exposed. However this attribute will now support the name of the style
attribute not only the "AUTO" value.

Files affected
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To implement the solution the following files would require to be changed:

- mapserver.h => Add the declaration for msLayerGetFeatureStyle and msOGRUpdateStyleFromString
- mapogr.cpp => Add msOGRUpdateStyleFromString and msOGRUpdateStyle
- maplayer.c => Modify msLayerWhichItems and implement msLayerGetFeatureStyle
- mapdraw.c => Call msLayerGetFeatureStyle in addition to msLayerGetAutoStyle

Backwards Compatibilty Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Currently 'STYLEITEM "AUTO"' has only been implemented in the OGR driver which
overrides LayerGetAutoStyle with a custom implementation. This behaviour would
continue to work as previously since the generic implementation would not affect those
drivers which provide custom auto style implementation.

When using the 'STYLEITEM "mystyleattribute"' setting, we provide a generic implementation
to set the style directly from the feature attribute and no driver specific
function will be called. This option will work for all drivers in the same way.

Further Considerations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the future we may provide support further style representations in addition to
the mapserver and OGR style strings. Each new representation will require a 
proper (and fast) method to identify the format from the style string itself.

Using the OGR style format will require the OGR driver to be compiled in. If we compile
MapServer without OGR support and the 'STYLEITEM "mystyleattribute"' option is used,
those features may not be rendered correctly where the actual style format is OGR
style string.
