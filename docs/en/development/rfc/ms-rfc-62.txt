Description: This RFC proposes to extend the ability of the WFS GetFeature
request to support formats other than GML.  Support for template query 
formatting (aka RFC 36) is introduced as well as support for output to 
OGR outputs.  Control of output formats is managed via appropriate
OUTPUTFORMAT declarations.


WFS GetFeature Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1) If the WFS OUTPUTFORMAT value is not one of the existing supported values, 
then the set of outputFormatObj's for the map will be searched for one with
a matching name or mime type and an image mode of MS_IMAGEMODE_FEATURE.

2) If the wfs_formats metadata exists on the layer, it should be a comma
delimited list of output formats permitted for this layer.  Any other will not
be selectable with the OUTPUTFORMAT parameter to GetFeature.

3) The existing GML2/GML3 generation support will be retained in essentially
it's current form within mapwfs.c, but it's preamble and postfix generation
will be moved into separate functions to reduce the "gml clutter" in the
main msWFSGetFeature() function. 

4) If an outputFormatObj is being used instead of GML output, it will be
generated by a call to msReturnTemplateQuery() which already supports output
via the new template engine (RFC 36) as well as call outs for other renderers.


outputFormatObj
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A new image mode value will be added, MS_IMAGEMODE_FEATURE, intended to 
be approriate for formats that are feature oriented, and cannot be meaningfully
seen as an image.  RFC 36 style template output format declarations will now
default to this imagemode.  The WFS GetFeature() directive will only 
support output formats of this image mode.

As well a new renderer value, MS_RENDER_WITH_OGR, will be added for OGR 
output. 


OGR OUTPUTFORMAT Declarations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The OGR renderer will support the following FORMATOPTION declarations:

DSCO:*  
  Anything prefixed by DSCO: is used as a dataset creation option with the
  OGR driver.


LCO:* 
  Anything prefixed by LCO: is used as a layer creation option. 


FORM=simple/zip/multipart
  Indicates whether the result should be a simple single file (single), a
  mime multipart attachment (multipart) or a zip file (zip).  "zip" is
  the default.


STORAGE=memory/filesystem/stream
  Indicates where the datasource should be stored while being written. 
  "file" is the default.

  If "memory" then it will be created in /vsimem/ - but this is only suitable
  for drivers supporting VSI*L which we can't easily determine automatically.

  If "file" then a temporary directory will be created under the IMAGEPATH
  were the file(s) will be written and then read back to stream to the 
  client. 

  If "stream" then the datasource will be created with a name "/vsistdout"
  as an attempt to write directly to stdout.  Only a few OGR drivers will 
  work properly in this mode (ie. CSV, perhaps kml, gml). 


COMPRESSION=none/gzip
  Should gzip compression be applied as the result is returned?  This is
  generally not suitable for use with FORM=zip which is already compressing
  the image.  "none" is the default.

GEOMTYPE=None/Unknown/Point/LineString/Polygon/GeometryCollection/MultiPoint/MultiLineString/MultiPolygon
  This sets the OGR geometry type of the output layer created.  It defaults
  to "Unknown".  

FILENAME=name
  Provides a name for the datasource created, default is "result.dat".  

Examples::

  OUTPUTFORMAT
    NAME "CSV"
    DRIVER "OGR/CSV"
    MIMETYPE "text/csv"
    FORMATOPTION "LCO:GEOMETRY=AS_WKT"
    FORMATOPTION "STORAGE=memory"
    FORMATOPTION "FORM=simple"
    FORMATOPTION "FILENAME=result.csv"
  END

  OUTPUTFORMAT
    NAME "OGRGML"
    DRIVER "OGR/GML"
    FORMATOPTION "STORAGE=filesystem"
    FORMATOPTION "FORM=multipart"
    FORMATOPTION "FILENAME=result.gml"
  END

  OUTPUTFORMAT
    NAME "SHAPEZIP"
    DRIVER "OGR/ESRI Shapefile"
    FORMATOPTION "STORAGE=memory"
    FORMATOPTION "FORM=zip"
    FORMATOPTION "FILENAME=result.zip"
  END


OGR Renderer Implementation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The OGR Renderer will be implemented as the function msOGRWriteFromQuery()
in the new file mapogroutput.c.  It will create a new OGR datasource based
on the information in the output format declaration.  It will then 
create an output layer for each map layer with an active, non-empty 
query resultcache.  Those resultcache shapes will be written. 

- The gml_include_items and gml_exclude_items rules will be used to decide 
  what attributes should be written to the output layers. 
- The gml field name aliasing mechanism will be supported for OGR output.
- The gml_[item]_type metadata will be supported for OGR output. 
- The gml_[item]_width (new) metadata will be supported for OGR output.
- The gml_[item]_precision (new) metadata will be supported for OGR output.
- When gml_[item]_type metadata is not available then all fields will be
  created with a type of OFTString.
- Some features, such as zip output, will only be supported with GDAL/OGR 1.8.
  These features will be made conditional on the GDAL/OGR version.


Geometry Types Supported
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In MapServer we have POINT, LINE and POLYGON layers which also allow for
features with multiple points, lines or polygons.  However, in the OGC
Simple Feature geometry model used by OGR a point and multipoint layer are
quite distinct.  Likewise for a LineString and MultiLineString and 
Polygon an MultiPolygon layer type.  When features written to a layer could
be of distinct types like this the only way we can create the layer is as
geometry type "wkbUnknown" - that is with no distinct geometry type. 

Some drivers, such as the OGR shapefile driver will establish a specific
geometry type based on the first geometry encountered and discard with an
error features of an unsupported geometry type.  Some drivers support mixtures
of geometry types.  

The GEOMTYPE FORMATOPTION make it possible to force creation of the 
layer with a particular geometry type. 


Attribute Field Definitions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For OGR output it is highly desirable to be able to create the output fields
with the appropriate datatype, width and precision to reflect the source
feature definition.  In the past for GML output the gml_[item]_type metadata
provided a mechanism for users to manually set the field type in generated
GML as there was no supported mechanism to automatically discovered. 

As a further step, for the OGR output mechanism it is planned to offer
support for two new data items, gml_[item]_width and gml_[item]_precision
which default the width and precision (number of decimal places) for 
fields.

It is not immediately planned to utilize the field width and precision
information in the GML output though that may prove useful.  The width and
precision metadata will be parsed by msGMLGetItems() and added into the 
gmlItemObj structure.  Values of "0" indicate a value is not known.


gml_types auto
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Setting the field type information for all fields in a layer is tedious
and error prone.  So as a further extension it is intended to support a
mechanism to automatically discover field type, width and precision for
some data sources.  This will be requested by setting the "gml_types" 
metadata item to a value of "auto".  This will be taken as a clue to 
implementing layer types to set the various metadata items on the layer
to define the fields type, width and precision when the GetItems layer
method is called. 

As part of the development effort for this RFC support for automatic 
field definition discovered will be implemented for "OGR", "POSTGIS", 
"ORACLE" and "SHAPEFILE" layers.   The maintainers of other feature 
sources can implement support if and when it is convenient.


Use of CPL Services
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Support for WFS OGR output is dependent on USE_OGR being defined.  But
when available it implies that GDAL/OGR CPL (Common Portability Library)
services are also available.  These include the virtual file system 
interface (VSI*L) which provides services like "in memory" files.  The 
/vsimem services will be used to avoid writing intermediate files to disk
if STORAGE=memory, the default configuration.

Note that the /vsimem/ service is already being used for WMS layers to 
avoid having to write images from remove WMS servers to disk, in WCS
to avoid writing GDAL-written images to disk and in WMS when using GDAL
based outputformats.  So this isn't really new. 

As well, CPL includes support for gzip compression via the /vsigzip 
virtual filesystem handler.

In the past GDAL has *not* had support for writing zip files; a feature
that is very desirable as a mechanism for both compressing and grouping 
multi-file sets produced by many OGR drivers.  As part of the development
undertaken for this RFC it is intended that GDAL will be extended with 
a CPL API for writing zip files, or alternatively a /vsizip/ virtual file
system mechanism to write files.  


Backwards Compatibilty Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



Further Considerations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- It should be noted that the DescribeFeatureType WFS operation will still only
  support GML formatted description for feature types.  
- A prototype implementation has been developed (by Frank Warmerdam) and is
  working though it is not quite feature complete, and will need some refinement
  before it can be committed.
- It is convenient to use the metadata and other structure originally 
  intended to drive GML production but it does cause some confusion when 
  "gml" metadata items are used to drive non-GML output.  


Outstanding Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- How do we alter msReturnTemplate() to support the WFS limit on number
  of features, and offset to the first feature?
- What are the implications if queries in other circumstances than WFS
  GetFeature picking an OGR output format?


Testing
~~~~~~~

The msautotest/wxs suite will be extended with a few tests of OGR output.
This will likely revolve around producing text output formats so it will
be easy to compare to previous results as we do with gml output.   Some
advanced features, such as zipped output may not be convenient to add 
regression testing for.


Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Documentation updates willb be required in the following documents:

- WFS Server: extensive discussion of new gml items, and how OGR and templated
  output is invoked and controlled.
- MapFile Reference: Add information on OGR OUTPUTFORMAT declarations.
- Ideally we ought to document the new "gml_types auto" stuff in the document
  on how to write feature layer implementations, but the only document on this
  is RFC 3 which does not seem to define what the functions are supposed to 
  do for the most part.
