<p>In this post I will document my playing arround with mapserver. I'll do my best to update this as best I can, but consider this as on 'under construction status'...
</p>
<p>Debian Lenny comes with version 5 of mapserver, so in order to install it you just need to type in the terminal as root:
</p>
<p>apt-get install cgi-mapserver mapserver-bin mapserver-doc  php-mapscript python-mapscript.
</p>
<p>If you don't have apache2 running and configured than you should also install apache2.</p>

<p>In debian cgi-scripts are install by default to /usr/lib/cgi-bin but are linked to /cgi-bin in the default install of apache2 in debian.</p>

<p>The next step is to install the simple map server application from 
<a href="http://maps.dnr.state.mn.us/mapserver_demos/workshop-5.0.zip">here</a>. After you download the zip file, extract it and copy it to /var/www/. NOTE: The extract of the file creates a folder named workshop, I changed it mapserver. Hence after renaming and copying the folder, I now have an apache root folder and which lookes likethis:</p>

<p>/var/www/mapserver/</p>

<p>this folder has all the demo files and can be accessed from the web-browser by typing in the adress bar:</p>

<p>localhost/mapserver.</p>

<p>This will lauch the first mapserver application. However, since this demo was originaly compiled for different systems, we need to edit the files a little bit.</p>

<p>First we need to edit index.html to fit the setting of the debian system.</p>

<p>replace lines 9-10  with the following:</p>

<p>var snippet = "IMAGEPATH '/var/www/mapserver/tmp/'"; //where data is written</p>
<p>snippet += " IMAGEURL '/mapserver/tmp/'";</p>

<p>make sure you create tmp/ under mapserver/</p>

<p>change line 34 to the following:</p>

<p>&lt;form name="demo" method="GET" action="../cgi-bin/mapserv" </p><p>onSubmit="configure()"&gt;</p>

<p>and lines 42-45 to:</p>

<p>&lt;input type="hidden" name="map" value="/var/www/mapserver/itasca.map"&gt;
&lt;input type="hidden" name="program" value="../cgi-bin/mapserv"&gt;
&lt;input type="hidden" name="root" value="/mapserver"&gt;</p>

<p>now we need to edit itasca.map to the following:</p>

<p>#WMS_ONLINERESOURCE "http://localhost/mapserver/index.html".</p>

<p>Now when you direct your browser to 'localhost/mapserver/index.html' you should be able to see the produced maps.</p>
