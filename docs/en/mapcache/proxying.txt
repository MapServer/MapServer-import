Proxying Unsupported Requests

MapCache has the ability to forward any incoming request that it cannot
natively respond to (either by returning a tile directly, by :ref:`merging
<mapcache_tile_assembling>` multiple tiles, etc...).

This setup allows mapcache to be placed transparently in front of an existing
OGC-service supplying server to accelerate tiled or getmap requests for a
selected number of :ref:`grids <mapcache_grids>`, while maintaining service
compatibility for, e.g., unsupported grids, WFS requests, ...

.. note::

  The proxying of requests is configured inside the :ref:`WMS <mapcache_wms>`
  MapCache service, which is semantically awkward.
