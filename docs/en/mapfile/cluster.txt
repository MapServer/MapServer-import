 CLUSTER
*****************************************************************************

The CLUSTER configuration option provides to combine multiple features from 
the layer into single (aggregated) features based on their relative positions.
Supported only for POINT layers.

The clustered layer itself provides the following aggregated attributes: 

1) Cluster:FeatureCount - count of the features in the clustered shape 
2) Cluster:Group - The group value of the cluster (to which the group expression is evaluated)

These attributes (in addition to the attributes provided by the original data source) can be used to configure 
the labels of the features and can also be used in expressions. 
The ITEMS processing option can be used to specify a subset of the attributes from the original 
layer in the query operations according to the user's preference.

We can use simple aggregate functions (Min, Max, Sum, Count) to specify how the clustered attribute should be
calculated from the original attributes. The aggregate function should be specified as a prefix separated by ':' in
the attibute definition, like: [Max:itemname]. If we don't specify aggregate functions for the source
layer attributes, then the actual value of the cluster attribute will be non-deterministic if the cluster contains
multiple shapes with different values. The Count aggregate function in fact provides the same value as Cluster:FeatureCount.

MAXDISTANCE [double]
    Specifies the distance of the search region (rectangle or ellipse) in pixel positions.
  
REGION [string]
    Defines the search region around a feature in which the neighbouring features are negotiated.
    Can be 'rectangle' or 'ellipse'.
    
:ref:`GROUP <expressions>` [string]
    This expression evaluates to a string and only the features that have the
    same group value are negotiated. This parameter can be omitted. The evaluated group value is 
    available in the 'Cluster:Group' feature attribute.
    
:ref:`FILTER <expressions>` [string]
    We can define the FILTER expression filter some of the features from the final output.
    This expression evaluates to a boolean value and if this value is false 
    the corresponding shape is filtered out. 
    This expression is evaluated after the the feature negotiation is completed, therefore
    the 'Cluster:FeatureCount' parameter can also be used, which provides the option
    to filter the shapes having too many or to few neighbors within the search region.
