 OUTPUTFORMAT
*****************************************************************************

A map file may have zero, one or more OUTPUTFORMAT object declarations, 
defining available output formats supported including formats like PNG, 
GIF, JPEG, GeoTIFF and Flash (SWF).

If OUTPUTFORMAT sections declarations are not found in the map file, the 
following implicit declarations will be made. Only those for which support 
is compiled in will actually be available. The GeoTIFF depends on building 
with GDAL support, and the Flash (SWF) depends on compiling with support 
for the MING library.

NAME [name]
    The name to use use in the IMAGETYPE keyword of the map file to 
    select this output format.(optional)

DRIVER [name]
    The name of the driver to use to generate this output format. Some driver 
    names include the definition of the format if the driver supports multiple 
    formats. For AGG, the possbile driver names are "AGG/PNG" and "AGG/JPEG".
    For GD the possible driver names are "GD/Gif", "GD/PNG", 
    "GD/WBMP" and "GD/JPEG". For flash the driver is just called "SWF". For 
    output through GDAL the GDAL shortname for the format is appended, such 
    as "GDAL/GTiff". Note that PNG, JPEG and GIF output can be generated with 
    either GDAL or GD (GD is generally more efficient).(mandatory)

IMAGEMODE [PC256/RGB/RGBA/INT16/FLOAT32]
    Selects the imaging mode in which the output is generated. Does matter 
    for non-raster formats like Flash. Not all formats support all 
    combinations. For instance GD/GIF supports only PC256. (optional)

    - PC256: Produced a pseudocolored result with up to 256 colors in 
      the palette (traditional MapServer mode)
    - RGB: Render in 24bit Red/Green/Blue mode. Supports all colors 
      but does not support transparency.
    - RGBA: Render in 32bit Red/Green/Blue/Alpha mode. Supports all 
      colors, and alpha based transparency. All features are rendered
      against an initially transparent background.
    - BYTE:  Render raw 8bit pixel values (no presentation).  Only 
      works for RASTER layers (through GDAL) and WMS layers currently.
    - INT16: Render raw 16bit signed pixel values (no presentation). 
      Only works for RASTER layers (through GDAL) and WMS layers currently.
    - FLOAT32: Render raw 32bit floating point pixel values 
      (no presentation). Only works for RASTER layers (through GDAL) 
      and WMS layers currently.

MIMETYPE [type]
    Provide the mime type to be used when returning results over the web. 
    (optional)

EXTENSION [type]
    Provide the extension to use when creating files of this type. (optional)

TRANSPARENT [ON/OFF]
    Indicates whether transparency should be enabled for this format. Note 
    that transparency does not work for IMAGEMODE RGB output. Not all formats 
    support transparency (optional). When transparency is enabled for the 
    typical case of 8-bit pseudocolored map generation, the IMAGECOLOR color 
    will be marked as transparent in the output file palette. Any other map 
    components drawn in this color will also be transparent, so for map 
    generation with transparency it is best to use an otherwise unused color 
    as the background color.

.. _FORMATOPTION:

FORMATOPTION [option]
    Provides a driver or format specific option. Zero or more FORMATOPTION 
    statement may be present within a OUTPUTFORMAT declaration. (optional)

    - GD/JPEG: The "QUALITY=n" option may be used to set the quality of 
      jpeg produced (value from 0-100).
    - GD/PNG: The "INTERLACE=[ON/OFF]" option may be used to turn 
      interlacing on or off.
    - GD/GIF: The "INTERLACE=[ON/OFF]" option may be used to turn 
      interlacing on or off.
    - GDAL/GTiff: Supports the TILED=YES, BLOCKXSIZE=n, BLOCKYSIZE=n, 
      INTERLEAVE=[PIXEL/BAND] and COMPRESS=[NONE,PACKBITS,JPEG,LZW,DEFLATE] 
      format specific options.
    - GDAL/\*: All FORMATOPTIONs are passed onto the GDAL create function. 
      Options supported by GDAL are described in the detailed documentation 
      for each GDAL format
    - GD/PNG and AGG/PNG both support quantizing from 24/32 bits to 8bits,
      in order to reduce the final image size (and therefore save bandwidth) (see
      also http://trac.osgeo.org/mapserver/ticket/2436#comment:4 for strategies
      when applying these options):

        - "QUANTIZE_FORCE=on" used to reduce an RGB or RGBA image into an 8bit 
          (or less) paletted images. The colors used in the palette are selected
          to best fit the actual colors in the RGB image (RGBA quantization was
          introduced in mapserver 5.2, and requires the --enable-experimental-png
          flag to be used when configuring)
        - "QUANTIZE_COLORS=256" used to specify the number of colors to be used
          when applying quantization. Maximum value is 256. Specifying anything
          between 17 and 255 is probably a waste of quality as each pixel is still
          encoded with a full byte. Specifying a value under 16 will produce tiny
          images, but severly degraded.
        - "QUANTIZE_NEW=on" used to force using a slower but higher quality 
          quantization algorithm for RGB images. The default behavior is to use
          a fast but crude quantization algorithm, that usually results in duplicate
          entries in the palette, and visible artifacts when tiling.
        - "PALETTE_FORCE=on" is used to reduce image depth with a predefined palette.
          This option is incompatible with the previous quantization options.
        - "PALETTE=/path/to/palette.txt" is used to define the absolute path where 
          palette colors can be found. This file must contain 256 entries of r,g,b
          triplets for RGB imagemodes, or r,g,b,a quadruplets for
          RGBA imagemodes. The expected format is one triplet (or quadruplet) per
          line, each value separated by commas, and each triplet/quadruplet on a
          single line. If less than 256 triplets are found
          in the file, 256-n remaining colors will be computed by quantization.
