Introduction
------------
This document presents a simple shell script that can be used to "wrap" the 
MapServer CGI, in order to avoid having to specify the 'map' parameter (or any 
other chosen parameters) in your MapServer URLs.

Script Information
------------------

If you want to avoid having to specify the 'map' parameter in your MapServer
URLs, one solution is to use a "wrapper". Basically, a wrapper is a CGI program
that receives an incoming CGI request, modifies the request parameters in some
way, and then hands off the actual processing to another CGI program (e.g.
MapServer).

The following shell scripts are wrappers for CGI GET requests that should be
generic enough to run on any OS with /bin/sh.

Alternative 1
......................................................................

::

    #!/bin/sh
    MAPSERV="/path/to/my/mapserv"
    MS_MAPFILE="/path/to/my/mapfile.map" exec ${MAPSERV}

You should set the MAPSERV and MS_MAPFILE variables as appropriate for
your configuration. MAPSERV points to your MapServer executable, and
MS_MAPFILE points to the mapfile you want MapServer to use. Both
variables should be absolute file paths that your webserver has
permission to access, although they need not (and probably should not)
be in web-accessible locations.  Put the script in your web server's
cgi-bin directory, and make it executable.

This solution should support both GET and POST requests.

Alternative 2
......................................................................

::

    #!/bin/sh
    MAPSERV="/path/to/my/mapserv"
    MAPFILE="/path/to/my/mapfile.map"
    if [ "${REQUEST_METHOD}" = "GET" ]; then
      if [ -z "${QUERY_STRING}" ]; then
        QUERY_STRING="map=${MAPFILE}"
      else
        QUERY_STRING="map=${MAPFILE}&${QUERY_STRING}"
      fi
      exec ${MAPSERV}
    else
      echo "Sorry, I only understand GET requests."
    fi
    exit 1
    # End of Script

You should set the MAPSERV and MAPFILE variables as appropriate for your
configuration. MAPSERV points to your MapServer executable, and MAPFILE points
to the mapfile you want MapServer to use. Both variables should be absolute
file paths that your webserver has permission to access, although they need not
(and probably should not) be in web-accessible locations. Then put the script
in your web server's cgi-bin directory, and make it executable.

Although this script only sets the 'map' parameter, it is easily modified to
set any number of other MapServer parameters as well. For example, if you want
to force your MapServer to 'map' mode, you can simply add 'mode=map' to the
front of the QUERY_STRING variable. Just remember to separate your parameters
with ampersands ('&').

Finally, note that the script only works for GET requests.
