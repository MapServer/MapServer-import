          <p align="left">Whoa! What happened here?</p>
          <p align="left">You've just experienced on-the-fly reprojection. When 
            a PROJECTION object is defined in the mapfile, MapServer passes the
            layer and projection info to the Proj.4 library which does the 
            reprojection.  For more information about the Proj.4 library, please 
            visit 
            <a href="http://proj.maptools.org/">
              http://proj.maptools.org/
            </a>.
          </p>
          <p>This example attempts to shed some light on the projection support 
            in MapServer.
          </p>
          <hr>
          <p align="left">This is what the mapfile looks like (Example1-6.map):
            <br>
            <iframe width="100%" src="example1-6.map"></iframe>
          </p>
          <hr align="center" width="300">
          <p>The first thing you might have noticed with our mapfile is the 
            original EXTENT has been commented out and the new EXTENT values
            don't look anything like latitude and longitude values. Also, we
            have added a PROJECTION object near the top and within each of our
            layers.
          </p>
          <p>Let's have a look at the new object and parameter:</p>
          <p>EXTENT  201621.496941 -294488.285333 1425518.020722
            498254.511514<br>
            The extent we provide to MapServer needs to be in the same
            units as the output projection.  Since Lambert Azimuthal
            Equal-Area's units are in meters, we have to give the new extent in
            meters.  We can calculate the new extent using ArcView or some
            other GIS package, or you can use Proj.4's cs2cs utility.  The 
            command below is what can be used to reproject the original extent 
            values:
          </p>
<pre>
cs2cs +proj=latlong +datum=WGS84 +to +proj=laea +ellps=clrk66 +lat_0=45 +lon_0=-100
</pre>
          <p>After typing the command, enter the southwestern coordinate pair
            (the lower left coordinates), separated by a space:
            &nbsp;-97.5 41.619778<br>
            to which the "cs2cs" utility gives the values:</p>
          <pre>
            208398.01       -372335.44 0.000
          </pre>
          <p>I then type the northeastern coordinate pair (upper right corner
            coordinates), again separated by space: &nbsp;-82.122902 49.38562
            and the following values are returned:
          <pre>
            1285308.08      632638.93 0.000
          </pre>
          <p>You will notice that "cs2cs" returns a set of three values.  You
            can ignore the third value, 0.000, as it means to represent altitute
            (which we're not using).  Anyway, we can not present the EXTENT as:
          </p>
          <pre>
            EXTENT 208398.01 -372335.44 1285308.08 632638.93
          </pre>
          <p>But it doesn't match up the extent above, you say.  Well, that's 
            what usually happens when you reproject--the map doesn't
            necessarily get centered as you'd expect.  You can fudge around it, 
            taking a few thousand meters off to the left and adding a few to
            the right.  Or, you can use a graphical GIS package to give you the 
            extent.  
            <a href="/tutorial/arcview_extent.html" target="_blank">
              Here are the instructions
            </a>
            for getting EXTENT using ArcView.
          <p>MapServer can take projection definitions in two ways. The first
            is shown in the mapfile's output PROJECTION object (the first
            PROJECTION block). This is the traditional way of passing
            parameters to the Proj.4 library. The other way is to use the EPSG
            codes. These codes are standard projection codes (or spatial
            reference identifiers) as defined by the European Petroleum Survey 
            Group (EPSG). In the case of our Lambert Azimuthal Equal-Area 
            projection, it has a code of &quot;2163&quot;. If you comment out 
            the four lines after PROJECTION and uncomment the line 
            &quot;init=epsg:2163&quot;, this will provide the same information 
            to Proj.4. If you want to learn more about EPSG codes, have a look 
            at &quot;/usr/local/share/proj/epsg&quot; or 
            &quot;C:/proj/nad/epsg&quot; (&quot;/ms4w/proj/nad&quot; in MS4W). 
            Also, check out the EPSG web site at
