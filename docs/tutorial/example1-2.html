          <div align="center">
            <img border="1" src="/cgi-bin/mapserv.exe?map=/ms4w/apps/tutorial/htdocs/example1-2.map&layer=states_poly&layer=states_line&mode=map" />

          <p align="left">As in the first example, this image was generated by
            linking the source of the &lt;img&gt; tag to this URL:
            <a href="http://terrasip.gis.umn.edu/cgi-bin/mapserv.exe?map=/ms4w/apps/tutorial/htdocs/example1-2.map&mode=map">
              http://terrasip.gis.umn.edu/cgi-bin/mapserv.exe?map=/ms4w/apps/tutorial/htdocs/example1-2.map
              &amp;layer=states_poly&amp;layer=states_line&amp;mode=map
            </a>. This is how most of the examples in this section work.
          </p>
          <p align="left">Anyway, you'll notice that the map here is the same as 
            the first example. Yes, but the mapfile is different. Have a look.
          </p>
          <hr>
          <p align="left">This is what the mapfile looks like (Example1-2.map):
            <br>
            <iframe width="100%" src="example1-2.map"></iframe>
          </p>
          <hr align="center" width="300">
          <p>The mapfile structure, by objects, looks like this:</p>
          <pre>
                   MAP
              LAYER-|-LAYER
            CLASS-|   |-CLASS
          STYLE-|       |-STYLE</pre>
          <hr align="center" width="300">
          <p>Here we split the original layer into two layers. The first layer 
            is still a polygon layer but the STYLE no longer has OUTLINECOLOR. 
            The second layer is similar to the first except that the TYPE is 
            changed to LINE and the COLOR in the STYLE is changed to the same 
            color as the OUTLINECOLOR in the first example. This produces the 
            same image as the first one... So, why do it this way? If we 
            continue to add layers on top of the states layer, the outline will 
            most likely be covered up by these other layers.  To still see the 
            state boundaries after we add these other layers, we have to 
            separate the states boundary line layer from the states polygon 
            layer and put it on top of the other other layers.  There is order 
            in how we define/add layers and you'll see it clearly as we proceed 
            in this section.
