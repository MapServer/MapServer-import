          <p align="left">In addition to vector data support (point, lines,
            polygons, and annotations), MapServer can also display raster data.
            Through the use of GDAL library, MapServer can input and output
            multiple raster formats. Whereas in versions prior to 4.x raster
            input is limited to single layer, grayscale or indexed color images,
            MapServer now supports RGB and multispectral (multi-layer) images.
            This example shows how to select what layers to display when using
            multispectral data. There might be a noticeable performance hit when
            using RGB and multispectral images.
          </p>
          <p align="left">Because MapServer 5.x uses GD version 2.0.x library to
            generate output images, it supports RGB (24-bit or true color)
            output as well. So, along with 8-bit (indexed color or grayscale)
            PNG, you can now also use PNG24 (true color) for output. This
            example uses PNG24 as IMAGETYPE. As with RGB input, there might be
            a noticeable performance hit when using PNG24.
          </p>
          <p>MapServer can actually use GDAL to generate output images as well
            but that's another topic.  If you want to know more about it, look
            at the OUTPUTFORMAT object in the mapfile reference.

          <p align="left">This is what the mapfile looks like (Example1-5.map):

            <iframe width="100%" src="example1-5.map"></iframe>
          </p>
          <hr align="center" width="300">
          <p>The mapfile structure, by objects, looks like this:</p>
          <pre>
                                               MAP
               LAYER #1-------------LAYER #2----|----LAYER #3--------LAYER #4
            (states_poly)           (modis)       (states_line)   (states_label)

          <hr align="center" width="300">
          <p align="left">When you look at the mapfile, you'll see that the new 
            LAYER object is added below (after) the state POLYGON layer. Why? 
            MapServer displays layers in reverse order--last in, first out 
            (LIFO). The first layer defined in the mapfile is drawn at the
            bottom of the map.
          </p>
          <p>So, if we have drawn the state POLYGON layer, it would be on the 
            bottom. Since the raster layer gets drawn on top of it, we won't 
            see it. That's why the first layer gets the STATUS value of OFF. 
            The state LINE layer is defined below the raster layer so it gets 
            drawn on top (and you can see it). This is why we separated the
            state LINE layer from the state POLYGON layer. Of course the labels 
            get drawn on top of everything.
          </p>
          <p>MapServer can automatically turn layers on or off based on the 
            status of other layers--say you want the states polygon layer 
            turned off when the raster layer is turned on.  This is done by 
            using the REQUIRES parameter.  Keep this in mind as you might want 
            to use it once you start creating your own MapServer applications.
          </p>
          <p>Let's have a look at the new parameters introduced in the 
            mapfile:
          </p>
          <p>IMAGETYPE<br>
            This is not new but the value &quot;PNG24&quot; is. PNG24 is the 
            24-bit or true-color version of the PNG format. Instead of being 
            limited to 256 color combinations for our output image, MapServer 
            now have millions. By the way, try changing this value back to PNG.
            Notice the time it takes to generate the image using either formats.
            In choosing between true color and indexed color, take into account 
            the time it takes to generate the image.
          </p>
          <p>SYMBOLSET<br>
            Points to the path of the symbol definition file. The symbols in 
            this file are referenced by the SYMBOL parameter in the CLASS
            object. It's not really needed at this point but I thought I'd 
            throw this here now. Please refer to the
            <a href="http://ms.gis.umn.edu/docs/reference/helpcenterreferencemanual.2005-03-29.3713415295">

            </a> for further information.
          </p>
          <p>DATA &quot;raster/mod09a12003161_ugl_ll_8bit.tif&quot;<br>
            In the newly added LAYER object, the DATA parameter points to a 
            GeoTIFF image. Like vector datasets, MapServer supports multiple 
            raster file formats. This support is accomplished through use of 
            the GDAL library. For more information on the different raster 
            formats supported by MapServer and for general discussion on the 
            use of rasters in MapServer, please read the RASTER Data how-to at
            <a href="http://ms.gis.umn.edu/docs/howto/raster_data">
              http://ms.gis.umn.edu/docs/howto/raster_data
            </a>.
          </p>
          <p>TYPE RASTER<br>
            When using raster data (images) we use the value RASTER for the 
            parameter TYPE, as opposed to the POLYGON, LINE, and POINT values 
            for vector data and ANNOTATION for label IDs.
          </p>
          <p>PROCESSING &quot;BANDS=1,2,3&quot;<br>
            This LAYER object parameter is new in MapServer 4.x. The PROCESSING 
            keyword has many values but in this case we are using it to select 
            which bands in a multispectral image to display. The values here 
            are strings that will be passed to the GDAL library. Documentation 
            for this is currently minimal but please see the Mapfile Reference 
            for more examples of using the PROCESSING keyword.</p>
          <p> OFFSITE<br>
            This parameters tells MapServer what pixel values to render as
            background (or ignore). You can get the pixel values using image 
            processing or image manipulation programs (i.e. Imagine, Photoshop, 
            Gimp).
          </p>

          <p>To compare map creation speed when using RGB image as opposed to 
            indexed color image, replace the following lines in the mapfile:
          </p>
          <p>DATA &quot;raster/mod09a12003161_ugl_ll_8bit.tif&quot;<br>
            STATUS DEFAULT <br>
            TYPE RASTER <br>
            PROCESSING &quot;BANDS=1,2,3&quot; <br>
            OFFSITE 71 74 65
          </p>
          <p>with these:</p>
          <p> DATA &quot;raster/mod09a12003161_ugl_ll_idxa.tif&quot;<br>
            STATUS DEFAULT <br>
            TYPE RASTER<br>
            OFFSITE 70 74 66</p>
          <p>Also, try changing the IMAGETYPE from PNG24 to PNG.</p>
