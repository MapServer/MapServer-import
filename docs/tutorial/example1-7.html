          <p align="left">Another exciting feature of MapServer is its ability
            to use layers from other map servers. In this case, a MapServer
            application becomes a WMS (or WFS) client. MapServer can also share
            (or serve up) the layers in the mapfile to other map servers. This
            makes an application a WMS (or WFS) server. What is WMS or WFS?
            These are "web-based interoperability service" specifications
            published by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC). WMS stands for
            Web Map Service and WFS for Web Feature Service. The difference
            between these two specifications, in simple terms, is that WMS uses 
            web raster formats (PNG, GIF, JPEG) to share layers while WFS uses 
            GML, the Geography Markup Language. A third OGC interoperability 
            specification is the Web Coverage Services specification or
            WCS--MapServer supports this at the server level only. To find more 
            information about WMS, WFS, and WCS go the the
            <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org">
              OGC's web site</a> and look for the
            <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/specs/?page=specs">
              OGC Implementation Specifications</a> or
            <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/specs/?page=abstract">
              OGC Abstract Specifications</a>. The MapServer web site also has
            <a href="http://mapserver.gis.umn.edu/doc.html">
              documentation</a> and
            <a href="http://mapserver.gis.umn.edu/cgi-bin/wiki.pl">
              WIKI pages</a> for these specifications.

          <p align="left">This example shows you how to add a WMS layer in your
            mapfile.
          </p>
          <hr>
          <p align="left">This is what the mapfile looks like (Example1-7.map):
            <br>
            <iframe width="100%" src="example1-7.map"></iframe>
          </p>
          <hr align="center" width="300">
          <p>Let's have a look at the WMS layer:</p>
          <p>LAYER # MODIS WMS map from JPL<br>
            Marks the start of the WMS LAYER object.
          </p>
          <p>NAME modis_jpl<br>
            The LAYER identifier.
          </p>
          <p>TYPE RASTER<br>
            Since this the WMS layer is an image, we use RASTER as LAYER TYPE.
          </p>
          <p>OFFSITE 0 0 0 <br>
            Ignore the black background color
          </p>
          <p> STATUS DEFAULT<br>
            Turn this layer on by default.
          </p>
          <p>CONNECTIONTYPE WMS<br>
            The type of LAYER connection to use. The default is LOCAL--if we
            have to be explicit, we would add CONNECTIONTYPE LOCAL to all other
            vector and raster layers in our mapfile. Instead we only define
            connection types that are external. WMS is an external data layer,
            coming from another map server.
          </p>
          <p>CONNECTION "http://mapus.jpl.nasa.gov/wms.cgi?"<br>
            The connection string that allows us to &quot;get&quot; the data
            from another server. In the case of WMS connections, this is a URL.
            If we were using a PostGIS database, it would be an SQL statement.
            Please note that the string has to be in a single line in your
            mapfile.
          </p>
          <p> METADATA<br>
            marks the beginning of the METADATA object for our WMS layer.
            MapServer uses the parameters defined within this object along with
            the CONNECTION parameter above to form a valid WMS request to the
            WMS server.
          </p>
          <p>&quot;wms_srs&quot; &quot;epsg:4326&quot;<br>
            The WMS projection.  Sometimes the WMS server supports more than one
            projection.  If this is the case you might want to request the map
            in your output projection (epsg:2163).  Unfortunately, the JPL
            server doesn't support this projection.
          </p>
          <p>&quot;wms_name&quot; &quot;modis&quot;<br>
            The WMS layer name. This is like adding the parameter
            &quot;layers=modis&quot;.
          </p>
          <p>&quot;wms_server_version&quot; &quot;1.1.1&quot;<br>
            The WMS version the server complies to. MapServer adheres to version
            1.1.1.
          </p>
          <p>&quot;wms_format&quot; &quot;image/jpeg&quot; <br>
            The image format we expect to be receiving from the WMS server.  You
            can try replacing the value with &quot;image/png&quot; or something
            else.
          </p>
          <p>END<br>
            marks the end of the METADATA object
          </p>
          <p>To know more about adding WMS layers to your applications, please
            visit the
            <a href="http://mapserver.gis.umn.edu/doc/wms-client-howto.html">
              WMS Client HOW-TO document</a>.
          </p>
          <hr align="center" width="300">
          <p>In addition to adding the WMS layer object, there's also a new
            object under MAP. This is the WEB object. Within the WEB object are
            two parameters:
          </p>
          <p> IMAGEPATH '/data/tmp/'<br>
            The absolute local path to a web accessible temporary directory. The
            user running the web server processes should be able to write to
            this directory. Make sure that the path includes a slash (/) at the 
            end. (Your IMAGEPATH might look something like this: 
            &quot;/home/apache/htdocs/tmp/&quot; or 
            &quot;C:/Inetpub/wwwroot/tmp/&quot;.)
          </p>
          <p>IMAGEURL '/tmp/' <br>
            This is how IMAGEPATH will appear relative to the web server's root 
            directory. If we have to type the full URL for this, it will be 
            &quot;http://terrasip.gis.umn.edu/tmp/&quot;. Make sure that the 
            path includes a slash (/) at the end.
          </p>
          <p>Finally, within the MAP object, I added a new parameter: NAME. This
            is the identifier for the MAP object. MapServer uses this as prefix 
            to all images it creates and dumps to the &quot;tmp&quot; directory.
            It's not needed at this point but it also doesn't hurt to have it.
          </p>
          <hr align="center" width="300">
          <p>If you would like to share your data layers to other map servers, 
            you will need to add METADATA objects within your MAP object and 
            within each of the LAYER objects you would like to share. All the 
            WMS layers that you added from another server will automatically be 
            cascaded and will also become available to others. To know more 
            about how to make your MapServer application become a WMS server,
