            data, we can create a map like this:

          <p>Our mapfile still only has two layers but the polygon layer has
            been broken down into two classes. Let's have a look at the
            additional parameters:
          </p>
          <p>CLASSITEM<br>
            This keyword is used to specify what attribute to use in separating 
            the class objects. In this example that attribute is 
            &quot;CLASS&quot;. If you open the database file associated with 
            this layer's shapefile, you'll see that there's a column (attribute) 
            called &quot;CLASS&quot;.
          </p>
          <p>How do we know which attribute to use?  Well, database records in
            shapefiles are stored in DBF files.  You can open it in a 
            spreadsheet program such as Openoffice.org's Calc, or in a desktop 
            GIS software such as QGIS, Thuban, or ArcView.  If your data came 
            with a metadata (and it should!), you can skim through through that 
            metadata file for attribute information.  You can also use "ogrinfo" 
            to display basic attribute info in your shapefiles--look back at 
            example 1.1 (the last few lines after "Layer SRS WKT:" show the 
            attribute names and types).
          </p>
          <p>EXPRESSION<br>
            For each class, we specify what attribute value to use. This is the
            simplest form of EXPRESSION. EXPRESSIONs can be even more complex
            than this, allowing one to evaluate regular or logical expressions. 
            Please look at the mapfile reference page to see what you can do 
            with EXPRESSION.
