      <p><b><a name="intro">Introduction</a></b><br />
        This tutorial was designed to give new users a quick (relatively speaking) 
        introduction to the concepts behind MapServer. It is arranged into four sections with each section having
        one or more examples and increasing in complexity. Users can jump to any 
        section at any time although it is recommended that absolute beginners
        work on the first three sections sequentially.<br />
      </p>
      <p>Section one focuses on basic MapServer configuration concepts such as 
        layer and class ordering, using vector and raster data, projections and 
        labeling. Section two provides examples on how to use HTML templates to 
        create a simple interface for an interactive web mapping application. 
        Section three introduces the use of HTML templates to provide a &quot;query&quot; 
        interface. Finally, section four introduces some advanced user interface 
        concepts.<br>

        While some users can go through this tutorial in one day, those who work 
        on each example in detail can probably expect to finish in one week.<br />

      <p><b><a name="data">Tutorial Data</a></b><br />
        The dataset used in this tutorial was taken from the U.S. Department of 
        the Interior's National Atlas of the United States. You can visit their 
        web site at http://www.nationalatlas.gov. The dataset was clipped to the 
        upper great lakes region (Minnesota, Michigan, and Wisconsin) to reduce 
        storage size. Additional raster images were added courtesy of the TerraSIP 
        project at the University of Minnesota. When using this tutorial, you 
        are encouraged to use your own dataset.</p>
      <p>Like MapServer itself, this tutorial is open and customizable to anyone. 
        This was done in the hope that someone (or some folks) will help design 
        and develop it further.<br />

      <p><b><a name="prereq">Before Using the Tutorial</a></b><br />
        There are some prerequisites to using this tutorial:</p>
      <p>Users will need to have a web server installed and running on your computer. 
        This web server has to have support for common gateway interface (CGI) 
        programs.</p>
      <p> Users should have a basic understanding of web servers and internet 
        security. A poorly configured web server can easily be attacked by malicious 
        people. At the very least your software installation will be corrupted
        and you'll lose hours of productivity, at worst your computer can be used 
        to attack other computers on the internet. </p>
      <p>It is recommended that users of this tutorial read the &quot;<a href="http://mapserver.gis.umn.edu/doc/getstarted-howto.html">HOWTO 
        for Getting Started With MapServer</a>&quot; before proceeding with this 
        tutorial.</p>
      <p> To use this tutorial, users will need to have a web server and a MapServer 
        CGI program (mapserv or mapserv.exe) installed in their systems. MapServer 
        source code is available for download at <a href="http://mapserver.gis.umn.edu/dload.html">http://mapserver.gis.umn.edu/dload.html</a>. 
        Documentations exist on how to compile and install MapServer--for UNIX 
        users, please read the &quot;<a href="http://mapserver.gis.umn.edu/doc/unix-install-howto.html">MapServer 
        UNIX Compilation and Installation HOWTO</a>&quot;. Windows users can read 
        either the &quot;<a href="http://mapserver.gis.umn.edu/doc/win32_compile-howto.html">MapServer 
        Win32 Compilation and Installation HOWTO</a>&quot; or the &quot;<a href="http://mapserver.gis.umn.edu/doc/mapserver-cygwin-howto.html">MapServer 
        Cygwin Compilation and Installation HOWTO</a>&quot;. In addition, Windows 
        users can also download precompiled binaries from <a href="http://mapserver.gis.umn.edu/win32binaries.html">http://mapserver.gis.umn.edu/win32binaries.html</a>.<br />

      <p><b><a name="issues">Windows, UNIX/Linux Issues</a></b><br />
        This tutorial was created in Linux/UNIX but should work with minimal changes 
        on Windows platform. The main differences are the paths in the map files. 
        Windows users need to specify the drive letter of the hard disk where 
        their tutorial files reside. Here's an example:<br />
        A UNIX map file might include a parameter like this--SHAPEPATH &quot;/data/projects/tutorial/data&quot;. 
        In Windows, the same parameters might look like this--SHAPEPATH &quot;C:/data/projects/tutorial/data&quot; 
        or this--SHAPEPATH &quot;C:\data\projects\tutorial\data&quot;. </p>
      <p>Notice that either<a href="http://www.wsu.edu:8080/%7Ebrians/errors/backslash.html"> 
        slash or backslash</a> works in Windows. The usual backslash may work 
        well for you if you want to make a distinction between virtual (as in 
        URLs or web addresses) and local paths in your map file. However, if you 
        plan to move your application to UNIX at some point, you'll have the tedious 
        task of switching all backslashes to slashes.</p>
      <p>While we're on the subject of paths, keep in mind that paths in mapfiles 
        are typically relative to the system's root directory--the slash (&quot;/&quot;) 
        in UNIX or some drive letter (&quot;C:&quot;) in Windows. This is true 
        except when specifically asked to enter a URL or when referencing a URL. 
        When working with HTML template files, paths are relative to the web server's 
        root directory--i.e., &quot;/projects/tutorial35/&quot; is relative to 
        &quot;http://terrasip.gis.umn.edu/&quot;. Please read <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/stories/slashforward/">http://www.alistapart.com/stories/slashforward/</a> 
        for a few insights on URLs.</p>
      <p>Another issue is that UNIX executable files don't require a .EXE or .COM 
        extensions. They do in Windows. If you are using Windows, append .exe 
        to all instances of &quot;/cgi-bin/mapserv&quot; or &quot;/cgi-bin/mapserv50&quot; 
        to make it &quot;/cgi-bin/mapserv.exe&quot; or &quot;/cgi-bin/mapserv50.exe&quot;.<br />
