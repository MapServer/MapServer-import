          <div align="center">
            <img border="1" src="/cgi-bin/mapserv.exe?map=/ms4w/apps/tutorial/htdocs/example1-1.map&layer=states&mode=map" />
          </div>
          <p align="left">MapServer can create an image and dump it to a local
            directory or send it directly to the requesting web browser, as in
            this example. You can view it without the need for an html page,
            just enter this URL:
            <a href="/cgi-bin/mapserv.exe?map=/ms4w/apps/tutorial/htdocs/example1-1.map&layer=states&mode=map">
              http://&lt;insert hostname or IP address here&gt;/cgi-bin/mapserv.exe?
              map=/ms4w/apps/tutorial/htdocs/example1-1.map&amp;layer=states&amp;mode=map</a>
            (Remember to replace &quot;&lt;insert hostname or IP address here
            &gt;&quot; with your web server's name, e.g. &quot;localhost&quot;,
            or its IP address, e.g. &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;).
          </p>
          <p align="left">This URL can be
            broken into three parts: the first part, http://&lt;insert hostname
            or IP address here&gt;/cgi-bin/mapserv.exe?, calls the MapServer CGI
            program. If you invoke it as is you will get this familiar message:
          </p>

          <blockquote align="left">
            No query information to decode. QUERY_STRING is set, but empty.
          </blockquote>

          <p align="left">The next three parts are what make up the query
            string.  The query string contains the CGI parameters (variables and their values), with each parameter separated by an ampersand (&amp;). So, looking at the query string, the first parameter "map" has a value "/ms4w/apps/tutorial/htdocs/example1-1.map"--this
            tells the MapServer CGI program (mapserv or mapserv.exe) what
            mapfile to process/parse. The
            next parameter &quot;layer=states&quot;, tells mapserv.exe to "turn
            on" the states layer--recall that we named our layer object
            "states".  The last parameter, &quot;mode=map&quot;, tells
            mapserv.exe what to do with the output from the mapfile. In this
            case it tells mapserv.exe to dump the image directly to the web
            browser (the client), without first creating a temporary image on
            the server. The MapServer &quot;mode&quot; CGI variable takes
            values other than &quot;map&quot;. For example if you use
            &quot;mode=browse&quot;, MapServer will dump the image to a
            temporary directory on the server. The browse mode will not work now
            but we'll come back to it again later.

          <hr>
          <p align="left">This is what the mapfile looks like (Example1-1.map):
             <br>
            <iframe width="100%" src="example1-1.map"></iframe>
          </p>
          <hr align="center" width="300">
          <p>The
            <a href="http://mapserver.gis.umn.edu/doc/mapfile-reference.html">
              mapfile
            </a>
            is MapServer's basic configuration mechanism. It is made up of
            &quot;objects&quot; and each object can have keywords or other
            objects. It has a hierarchical structure such that some objects fall
            under other objects... on top of this hierarchy is the MAP object,
            all other objects belong to it. This example shows a very
            straightforward heirarchy of objects.  As you go through each
            example, the complexity of these hierarchical trees will increase.
          </p>
          <p>A few quick notes about mapfiles: we define each object in the 
            mapfile with the object name and we close it with &quot;END&quot; 
            and we precede comments with a pound (#) sign.
          </p>
          <p>Let's break &quot;example1-1.map&quot; down by objects. Its 
            structure looks like this:
          </p>
          <pre>
      MAP
       |-LAYER
         |-CLASS
           |-STYLE
          </pre>
          <hr align="center" width="300">
          <p>Let's look at the keywords (parameters) within the MAP object: </p>
          <p>MAP<br>
            Every mapfile starts with the MAP object--the entire mapfile is the 
            MAP object.
          </p>
          <p>IMAGETYPE<br>
            The keyword IMAGETYPE is used to define which image format the
            MapServer CGI program should use for output. In this case we are 
            using indexed color PNG (similar to GIF). This could be GIF, if we 
            compiled the GD library with GIF support, WBMP, or JPEG. We can also 
            specify other output options (PDF, SWF, GeoTIFF) provided that we
            compiled support for them and specify them with the OUTPUTFORMAT 
            object. The OUTPUTFORMAT goes beyond the scope of this tutorial but 
            you can find out more about by reading through documentations in the 
            MapServer web site.
          </p>
          <p>EXTENT<br>
            This parameter specifies the output extent of our map--the bounding 
            box of our initial map.  The EXTENT values are given in this format: 
            &lt;Lower Left X&gt; &lt;Lower Left Y&gt; &lt;Upper Right X&gt; 
            &lt;Upper Right Y&gt;, with spaces separating each value. This needs
            to be in the same units as the data or, if specifying a different
            output projection, in the same units as the output projection.
            <br>
            <br>
            In this example our data is in geographic projection so the units
            are in decimal degrees.  You can use the utility
            &quot;<a href="http://gdal.osgeo.org/ogr/ogr_utilities.html">ogrinfo</a>&quot;,
            which is part of the GDAL/OGR library package, to get the extent of
            a particular shapefile (or other supported vector formats).  Here is
            the command I used to get the extent for this example:

            <pre>ogrinfo -al -so states_ugl.shp</pre>
            
            This returned the following output:
            
            <pre>INFO: Open of `states_ugl.shp'
using driver `ESRI Shapefile' successful.

Layer name: states_ugl
Geometry: Polygon
Feature Count: 204
Extent: (-97.238976, 41.619778) - (-82.122902, 49.385620)
Layer SRS WKT:
(unknown)
AREA: Real (12.3)
PERIMETER: Real (12.3)
STATESP020: Real (11.0)
STATE: String (20.0)
STATE_FIPS: String (2.0)
CLASS: String (5.0)</pre>

            You can also use ArcView or other open source GIS packages--Quantum
            GIS, Thuban, etc.<br>  Feel free to change the values of EXTENT to 
            get a better understanding of how it changes your map.
          </p>
          <p>SIZE<br>
            This is the size of the image (the map) that MapServer will 
            generate, in pixels. So our map is 400 pixels wide by 300 pixels 
            high.  Again, change this to your heart's content and see how it 
            affects your map.
          </p>
          <p>SHAPEPATH<br>
            This is the path to your data layers. You can provide absolute paths
            (i.e. &quot;/ms4w/apps/tutorial/data&quot; or
            &quot;C:/ms4w/apps/tutorial/data&quot;) or paths relative to your
            mapfile's location (in this example, you'd use "../data"). This path
            doesn't have to be web accessible, and probably shouldn't be unless
            you want anyone to download your raw data. It has nothing directly 
            to do with the web so don't even think of URLs here--just make sure 
            that the user running the web server (usually &quot;nobody&quot; or
            &quot;apache&quot; in the *nix world) can READ the data in 
            the SHAPEPATH.
          </p>
          <p>IMAGECOLOR<br>
            This is the background color of your map. The values are RGB values 
            so 255 Red, 255 Green, and 255B which results in a white background. 
            Go ahead and play with this values.
          </p>
          <hr align="center" width="300">
          <p>Now let's look at the LAYER object parameters:</p>
          <p>LAYER<br>
            Marks the beginning of a LAYER within the MAP object. You can 
            specify as many layers as you'd like although you are limited to
            100, by default. To change this limit, you will have to edit the
            map.h header file (in the soure tree) and recompile MapServer.
          </p>
          <p>NAME<br>
            This is the layer identifier.  MapServer uses this name to toggle 
            the layer on and off.  It won't work in this example as we have the 
            layer STATUS set to default.  We will get back to this in later 
            examples.
          </p>
          <p>DATA<br>
            The name of the data (shapefile in this case). MapServer supports 
            vector data formats other than ESRI's shapefile through the use of 
            OGR library (part of the GDAL software package). Please visit the 
            GDAL project web site at 
            <a href="http://www.gdal.org/">
              http://www.gdal.org/
            </a> 
            and read
            <a href="http://www.gdal.org/ogr/index.html">
              http://www.gdal.org/ogr/index.html
            </a>
            to know more about the different vector formats MapServer supports. 
            In addition, Jeff McKenna and Tyler Mitchell have written a detailed 
            guide to using vector data in MapServer.  You can download this 
            guide (PDF) from 
            <a href="http://dl.maptools.org/dl/docs/mapserv/">
              http://dl.maptools.org/dl/docs/mapserv/
            </a>.
          </p>
          <p>TYPE<br>
            What type of data is it? If it's a vector data, you can specify
            whether it is a POLYGON, LINE (you use LINE even if your data is
            technically a POLYLINE), or a POINT. You can also specify RASTER or
            ANNOTATION data. Here we want to display POLYGON.
          </p>
          <p>STATUS<br>
            Layers are turned on or off based on their STATUS. DEFAULT is always
            on. ON or OFF works when the LAYER name is passed as part of the
            query string.
          </p>
          <hr align="center" width="300">
          <p>Let's look at the CLASS object parameters:</p>
          <p>CLASS<br>
            Marks the beginning of a CLASS object within the LAYER object. You
            can specify as many classes within a layer although you are limited
            to 50 by default. You'll have to recompile MapServer to change this
            default value.
          </p>
          <p>NAME<br>
            The descriptive identifier for this CLASS. LAYER objects can have
            multiple classes, just like MAP objects can have multiple layers.
            CLASS names are used by MapServer as labels for the legend so make
            sure to use an appropriate descriptive name when naming classes.
            We will talk about legends later in this tutorial.
          </p>
          <hr align="center" width="300">
          <p>And finally, let's look at the STYLE object parameters:</p>
          <p>STYLE<br>
            Marks the beginning of the STYLE object.  You can define multiple
            styles within a class--this is useful when you want to overlay a
            style over another.
          </p>
          <p>COLOR<br>
            This is the fill color of the polygon. In case the TYPE is LINE,
            this is the line color. The values are in RGB format.
          </p>
          <p>OUTLINECOLOR<br>
            This is the outline color of the polygons. The values are in RGB
            format.  MapServer doesn't draw polygon outlines by default, so if
            you want to see polygon boundaries, you will want to define an
            OUTLINECOLOR.
          </p>
          <hr align="center" width="300">
          <p>This ends the first example in this tutorial. You are encouraged to
            change the values of the keywords in the mapfile. It will help you
            understand what these keywords do.
