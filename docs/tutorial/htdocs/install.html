          <h1 align="center">Installing the MapServer CGI Program and the Tutorial</h1>
      
      <p>Before you can actually go through the tutorial, you'll need to make sure you have your web server running and the MapServer CGI program (mapserv or mapserv.exe) installed in your &quot;cgi-bin&quot; directory. For those working in Microsoft Windows environment, it is recommended that you use the MapServer for Windows (MS4W) package available at http://dl.maptools.org/dl/ms4w/.  This is a complete web mapping environment for Windows and includes the Apache web server, GDAL, Proj.4, MapServer, and all required libraries and useful utilities.
      </p>
      <p>To install the tutorial under MS4W, simply unzip the tutorial.zip archive to C:\ (or whichever drive MS4W is installed) and restart the web server. The tutorial files will be installed under \ms4w\apps\tutorial and an Apache configuration snippet will be installed as \ms4w\httpd.d\httpd_tutorial.conf.
      </p>
      <p>For those who are already familiar with web programming and would like an alternative MapServer binaries, Hobu provides Windows binaries at http://hobu.biz.  You will need to install a separate web server and other utilities yourself.  Another alternative is Frank Warmerdam's FWTools which includes MapServer and a host of other open source GIS utilities.  You can also try to compile MapServer yourself.  There are two versions of Win32 compilation how-to,one for <a href="http://mapserver.gis.umn.edu/doc/win32_compile-howto.html">MS Visual C++ compiler</a> and the other one for <a href="http://mapserver.gis.umn.edu/doc/mapserver-cygwin-howto.html">compiling under the Cygwin environment</a>. If you don't have a compiler or don't want to waste precious time compiling MapServer (and libraries), just download from one of the sites mentioned above.</p>
      
      <p>For Unix and Unix-like operating systems, you can search google for binary distribution for your particular platform.  If nothing turns up, you can always ask the MapServer-Users mailing list if such binaries exist.  If all else fail, you'll have to compile MapServer and the associated libraries.  The compilation and installation how-to for Unix is available at <a href="http://mapserver.gis.umn.edu/doc/unix-install-howto.html">http://mapserver.gis.umn.edu/doc/unix-install-howto.html</a>.

      <p>Assuming you've got the MapServer CGI program, follow the steps below 
        to install:</p>

          <td><strong>1a.</strong></td>
          <td> <p>If compiled in Unix, just copy the binary &quot;mapserv&quot; to your &quot;cgi-bin&quot; directory. On a locally compiled Apache server this will be on &quot;/usr/local/apache/cgi-bin/&quot; or /usr/local/apache2/cgi-bin&quot;. If your web server comes as part of your OS distribution, look for the &quot;cgi-bin&quot; directory or consult your OS's documentation.<br>

        <tr align="left" valign="top"> 
          <td><strong>1b.</strong></td>
          <td><p> If you compiled on Win32 platform, copy the binary &quot;mapserv.exe&quot; 
              to your &quot;cgi-bin&quot; or &quot;scripts&quot; directory. If 
              you compiled the projection support for MapServer, copy the contents 
              of &quot;proj-4.4.7\nad&quot; subdirectory to &quot;C:\Proj\nad&quot;. 
              You'll also need to copy all your supporting libraries to a directory 
              that's part of your system PATH. This would typically be &quot;C:\Windows\System&quot; 
              or &quot;C:\Winnt\System32&quot; but you can always add a different 
              directory in your system (not user) path. If your web server is 
              Apache, the &quot;cgi-bin&quot; directory is typically in &quot;C:\Program 
              Files\Apache Group\Apache\cgi-bin&quot;. If you are using Microsoft 
              IIS, the &quot;cgi-bin&quot; directory is typically called &quot;scripts&quot; 
              and is located in &quot;C:\Inetpub\scripts&quot;. As with Unix, 
              consult your web server's documentation for more information about 
              &quot;cgi-bin&quot; and CGI programs.<br>

          <td><p> If you are using Win32 binaries downloaded from the MapServer 
              web site, unzip the package to &quot;C:\MapServer&quot;. From &quot;C:\MapServer&quot; 
              copy &quot;mapserv.exe&quot; to your &quot;cgi-bin&quot; directory. 
              In Apache this would typically be &quot;C:\Program Files\Apache 
              Group\Apache\cgi-bin&quot; and in Microsoft IIS it is &quot;C:\Inetpub\scripts&quot;. 
              Copy the files from &quot;C:\MapServer\lib&quot; to C:\Windows\System 
              or C:\Winnt\System32, whichever is appropriate for your Windows 
              version. (Alternatively, you can edit your system PATH to include 
              &quot;C:\MapServer\lib&quot;. In this way you don't have to copy 
              the library files to your system directory.) Move &quot;C:\MapServer\Proj&quot; 
              to &quot;C:\Proj&quot;. This is required for projection support. 
              As with Unix, consult your web server's documentation for more information 
              about &quot;cgi-bin&quot; and CGI programs.<br>

              With your web server running, open this URL on a web browser: http://localhost/cgi-bin/mapserv?

              (on Windows). You should get the following message:</p>
            <p>No query information to decode. QUERY_STRING is set, but empty. 
            </p>
            <p>This means that MapServer is working but you haven't supplied it 
              with anything to process. If you've gotten this far and you've got 
              a different message than above, the first thing to do is to check 
              your error log and see what cause the message to appear. This typically 
              means that you are missing your library files (dll's). Rectify the 
              problem if you can, or check the <a href="http://mapserver.gis.umn.edu/doc/mapserver-FAQ.html">MapServer 
              FAQ</a>. Failing that, check the <a href="http://mapserver.gis.umn.edu/cgi-bin/wilma/mapserver-users">MapServer 
              Users mailing list archives</a>, and if the archive isn't helpful, 
              send an e-mail to the <a href="http://lists.gis.umn.edu/mailman/listinfo/mapserver-users">MapServer 
              Users mailing list</a> (you must be subscribed to send e-mail to

              &quot;mapserv&quot; or &quot;mapserv.exe&quot; to &quot;mapserv50&quot; 
              or &quot;mapserv50.exe&quot;. The other option is to change each 
              occurence of &quot;mapserv50 &quot;or &quot;mapserv50.exe&quot; 
              back to &quot;mapserv&quot; or &quot;mapserv.exe&quot; in the example 
              files--a very tedious process. This tells you that you can rename 
              the MapServer CGI binary to whatever you want. It isn't recommended 
              but if you run several versions of MapServer on the same machine, 
              you really don't have a choice.<br>

              install it is to unzip the archive to your web server's document 
              root directory--that's the &quot;htdocs&quot; directory in Apache 
              or &quot;C:\Inetpub\wwwroot&quot; in IIS. You will then have to 
              edit your html files to change every occurence of &quot;map=/data/projects/tutorial/example*.map&quot; 
              to &quot;map=/your/htdocs/directory/tutorial/example*.map&quot; 
              (Example: for example1-1.html, you'd change the occurence of &quot;map=/data/projects/tutorial/example1-1.map&quot;

          <td><p> You need to make a &quot;tmp&quot; directory and the easiest 
              way is to create &quot;tmp&quot; directory within Apache's &quot;htdocs&quot; 
              directory or IIS's &quot;wwwroot&quot; directory. You want to make 
              sure that your web server user account (that's usually &quot;nobody&quot; 
              in Unix and &quot;IUSR_MACHINENAME&quot; in IIS--MACHINENAME is 
              the name of your computer). For security, You also want to make 
              sure that users don't have execute permission in this directory. 
              (In Unix and while working as &quot;root&quot;, run the commands 
              &quot;chmod a+w /your/htdocs/directory/tmp&quot; and &quot;chmod 
              a-x /your/htdocs/directory/tmp&quot;. In Windows, you can use IIS 
              management console to change the permissions.) You will then need 
              to change the value of every occurence of the IMAGEPATH mapfile 
              keyword from &quot;/data/tmp/&quot; to &quot;/your/htdocs/directory/tmp/&quot; 
              (or in Windows, &quot;C:/your/htdocs/directory/tmp&quot; or &quot;C:/Inetpub/wwwroot/tmp&quot;).<br>
