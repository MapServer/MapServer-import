    AGG
        `Anti-Grain Geometry <http://antigrain.com>`__ A high quality graphics
        rendering engine that MapServer 5.0+ can use. It supports sub-pixel
        anti-aliasing, as well as many more features.

    CGI
        Wikipedia provides excellent coverage of 
        `CGI <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Gateway_Interface>`_.
    
    EPSG
        EPSG codes are numeric codes associated with coordinate system
        definitions. For instance, EPSG:4326 is geographic WGS84, and
        EPSG:32611 is "UTM zone 11 North, WGS84". The WMS protocol uses EPSG
        codes to describe coordinate systems. EPSG codes are published by the
        `OGP Surveying and Positioning Committee <http://www.epsg.org/>`_. A
        list of PROJ.4 definitions corresponding to the EPSG codes can be
        found in the file /usr/local/share/proj/epsg. See
        http://spatialreference.org for a listing of spatial references and an
        interface to search for spatial references.

    FreeType
        `FreeType <http://freetype.sourceforge.net/index2.html>`__ is a font
        engine that MapServer uses for accessing and rendering `TrueType
        <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_Type_Font>`__ fonts.
        
    GD
        `GD <http://www.libgd.org/Main_Page>`__ is a graphics library for 
        dynamic generation of images.  It was the first graphics renderer that 
        was available for MapServer, and it is required by MapServer to 
        operate.
        
    GDAL
        GDAL (Geospatial Data Abstraction Library) is a multi-format raster
        reading and writing library. It is used as the primary mechanism for
        reading raster data in MapServer. It is hosted at http://www.gdal.org/

    GEOS
        `Geometry Engine Open Source <http://trac.osgeo.org/geos>`__ is a C/C++ 
        port of the `Java Topology Suite <http://www.vividsolutions.com/jts/jtshome.htm>`__.
        It is used for geometric algebra operations like determining if a 
        polygon is contained in another polygon or determining the resultant 
        intersection of two or more polygons.  MapServer optionally uses GEOS for 
        geometric algebra operations.

    Map Scale
        A treatise of mapping scale can be found on 
        `about.com <http://geography.about.com/cs/maps/a/mapscale.htm>`_.
    
    Mapfile
        :ref:`Mapfile <mapfile>` is the declarative language that MapServer
        uses to define data connections, map styling, templating, and server
        directives. Its format is xml-like and hierarchical, with closing
        ``END`` tags, but the format is not xml.
    
    Mercator
        Wikipedia provides excellent coverage of the 
        `Mercator projection <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercator_projection>`_.

    OGC
        The `Open Geospatial Consortium <http://www.opengeospatial.org>`_ is a
        standards organization body in the GIS domain. Many of its web
        standards are implemented in MapServer.
    
    OGR
        `OGR <http://www.gdal.org/ogr>`__ is the vector data access portion of 
        the :term:`GDAL` library.  It provides access to a multitude of data 
        formats.  More information about OGR can be found in :ref:`ogr`.
        
    Proj.4
        `Proj4 <http://trac.osgeo.org/proj/>`__ is a library for projecting
        map data. It is used by MapServer and GDAL and a multitude of other
        Open Source GIS libraries.
        
    Projection
        A map projection is a mathematical transformation of the surface of a
        sphere (3D) onto a 2D plane. Due to the laws of the universe, each
        type of projection must make tradeoffs on how and what features it
        distorts.
    
    Raster
        A raster is a rectangular grid of pixels. Essentially an image.
        Rasters are supported in MapServer with a layer type of RASTER, and a
        variety of formats are supported including GeoTIFF, JPEG, and PNG.
    
    Shapefile
        Shapefiles are simple GIS vector files containing points, lines or
        areas. The format was designed and published by ESRI and is widely
        supported in the GIS world. It is effectively the native and highest
        performance format for MapServer. See `Wikipedia
        <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile>`_ for more information.
    
    SWIG
        `Simplified Wrapper Interface Generator <http://www.swig.org>`__ is the 
        library that MapServer uses for generating the language bindings for 
        all languages other than C/C++ and PHP.  :ref:`mapscript` describes 
        these bindings.
