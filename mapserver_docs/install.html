    <i>Note: detailed installation instructions can be found in the MapServer distribution
    in the files README.CONFIGURE and README.WIN32.</i>

        1) install supporting packages if desired. LibTIFF and FreeType are recommended<br>
        2) upack the required MapServer distribution files<br>
        3) run 'configure --help' to examine all build options<br>
        4) run 'configure' with options that meet your needs<br>
        5) do a 'make'<br>
        6) copy the mapserv to your CGI directory and start testing
    </menu>
    <p>
    <b>Note about shared libraries:</b> libTIFF, FreeType and other packages build shared 
    versions of their libraries by default. These libraries MUST be in a place that the user 
    the web server runs as knows about. A quick test will tell you if the mapserv program 
    is at least finding everything it needs to load. Enter the following as a URL once you 
    have the package installed: <b>http://your.server.name/cgi-bin/mapserv</b>. If everything 
    is ok you should recieve the following response (or something similar depending on your 
    web server) - "<i>No query information to decode. QUERY_STRING is set, but empty.</i>" If you 
    get a server error or document not found then something is wrong with the install, 
    not the MapServer. Most web servers can be configured to set environment variables 
    (like LD_LIBRARY_PATH) for processes they create.
    <p>
    <b><font size=+1 color="#3366cc" face="arial,helvetica">Win32 Installation</font></b>
    <p>
    To build the package using the Makefile.vc and NMAKE:

    <menu>
      - Edit Makefile.vc to select (or deselect) optional components of 
      the MapServer. <i>see README.WIN32 included with the distribution</i>
      <p>
      - Open a DOS prompt window
      <p>
      - Run the VCVARS32.BAT script to initialize the VC++ environment
      variables.  VCVARS32.BAT is automatically generated by the MSVC++
      install procedure and should be located in the BIN sub-directory of
      your MSVC++ installation.
      <p>
      - Then start the build with: nmake /f Makefile.vc 
    </menu>
    This will create "mapserv.exe" (the main MapServer CGI program), the
    other command-line utilities, and "mapserver.lib". Instructions for 
    building MapScript for Windows are not yet available.

    <b><font size=+1 color="#3366cc" face="arial,helvetica">Using newer versions of GD</font></b>
    <p>
    The version of <a href="http://www.boutell.com/gd">GD</a> (1.2) included in the 
    MapServer distribution reads/writes LZW GIF images. Using this version may violate 
    patents on the LZW compression algorithm held by <a href="http://www.unisys.com/">
    Unisys</a>. Even GD versions 1.3 to 1.5, which produce non-LZW GIFs, may technically 
    violate the Unisys patents. Starting with version 1.6 GD only reads/writes PNG files. 
    While PNG is a superior format to GIF not all browsers support PNG.
    <menu>
        1) Install the GD version of your choice. New versions need not be compiled with FreeType. 
             MapServer does not use any of the GD TrueType functions.<br>
        2) Edit Makefile and gdft/Makefile to reflect the version you wish to use.<br>
        3) Build as described above.
