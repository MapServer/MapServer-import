  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>
  The University of Minnesota's MapServer is an open-source and freely available map rendering engine for the web.  Due to it's
  open-source nature, it can be compiled on a wide variety of platforms and operating systems.  We will focus on how to obtain, compile
  and install MapServer on UNIX-like platforms. Throughout this document we will use the popular Linux and Apache combination for the
  examples, as well as the MapServer demo package.  
  </para>

  <para>
  This document assumes you are allready familiar with basic aspects of your operating system and web server:

  <title>Obtaining the necessary software</title>

  <para>
  You can obtain the source code as well as the demo package from the MapServer site, located at <ulink url="http://mapserver.gis.umn.edu">http://mapserver.gis.umn.edu</ulink>.
  </para>

  <para>
  MapServer also makes use of a variety of external librairies to enhance it's functionality.  Here is a short descriptive list of which
  ones they are an what purpose they serve:

  <title>Compiling</title>

  <para>The first thing you should do is unpack the source code tar-ball:

  <screen>
  [user@host user]$ tar -zxvf ms_3.4.000.tar.gz
  </screen>

  This will unpack the file into a directory called "mapserver".

  </para>

  <sect2 id="quickcompile">
   <title>The QUICK and DIRTY way</title>

   <para>If you're in a hurry, try this:
   <screen>
   [user@host user]$ cd mapserver
   [user@host mapserver]$ ./configure
   [user@host mapserver]$ make
   </screen>

   That's it ! Unless you got errors, MapServer is now compiled and ready to go.  You can now skip to the <link linkend="installation">
   installation</link> section.

   </para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="compileproper">
   <title>The RIGHT way</title>
  <para>Here we will learn in detail how to properly compile Mapserver.  There are two major steps to compiling a program from source: configuring the source code, and actually compiling it.</para>

      <sect3 id="configure">
	<title>Configuring the source code</title>

  <para>The best way to find out the options available at compile time is to run <application>configure</application> with the help
  parameter:</para>

  <screen>
  [user@host user]$ cd mapserver
  [user@host mapserver]$ ./configure --help
  </screen>

  <para>You will note the ability to specify which library to use, and from which location.  Under normal circumstances the configuration
  script will automatically find all the librairies on your system and use them:</para>

  <screen>
  [user@host mapserver]$ ./configure
  </screen>

  <para>Note the output of the above command and make sure that the configure script located all the librairies you want it to use.  If not, you may have to manually specify the location of the librairies.</para>

  <para>See an example on doing that in the following section.</para>

  <sect4 id="gd">
     <title>The GD Issue</title>

  <para>By default Mapserver will use the system librairies, including GD.  The problem is that nowadays most Linux distribution come
  with recent versions (>1.3) of GD that no longer supports GIF's, but PNG's instead.  This is often not prefered since PNG's, although
  superior, are not yet widely supported by all browsers.  Therefore, most Web developpers still prefer to use GIF's.
  </para>

  <para>The GD library stopped supporting GIF's because UNISYS, the patent holder for the LZW Compression algorythm used in GIF's, has
  started claiming royalty for the use of the said patent.  This makes it illegal for you to use GIF's unless you used a software package   licensed by UNISYS (Packages such as Corel/Adobe are safe, GD, being open-source, couldn't possibly be licensed), or you or your business hold such licenses.  So beware !</para> 

  <para>Thankfully, Mapserver is distributed with it's own older version of GD, which is GIF capable. In order to force it's use you would
  take the following steps:</para>
  
  <screen>
  [user@host mapserver]$ cd gd-1.2
  [user@host gd-1.2]$ make
  [user@host gd-1.2]$ cd .. 
  [user@host mapserver]$ ./configure --with-gd=gd-1.2/ <emphasis>(...and possibly other options)</emphasis>
  </screen>

  <sect4 id="manlib">
	  <title>Requesting specific librairies</title>
	  <para>Some librairies will NEVER be detected by default, and HAVE to be specified via the configure script.</para>

	  <para>The librairies are:</para>

	  <itemizedlist>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>PROJ.4: The on-the-fly projection conversion librairy (--with-proj).</para>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>SDE: Librairies for ESRI's Spatial Data Engine. These come from ESRI's product (--with-sde).</para>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>MPATROL: A debugging library (--with-mpatrol).</para>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>OGR: The vector file formats I/O library (--with-ogr).</para>
	    </listitem>
	  </itemizedlist>

	  <para>If the configure script can't find the librairies, you can allways specify the location manually by appending "=/usr/lib/sde/" for example.</para>
