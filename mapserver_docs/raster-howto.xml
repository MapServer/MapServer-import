<para>
    MapServer supports rendering a variety of raster file formats
    in maps.  The following describes some of the supported formats,
    and what capabilities are supported with what formats.
</para>
<para>
This document assumes that you are already familiar with setting up MapServer
map files, but does explain the raster specific aspects of map files. 
</para>

</sect1>

<!-- ====================================================================== -->

<sect1 id="definition">  <title>How are rasters added to a Map file?</title>

<para>
A simple raster layer declaration looks like this.  The DATA file is
interpreted relative to the SHAPEPATH, much like shapefiles.  
</para>

<para>
<programlisting>
LAYER
  NAME "JacksonvilleNC_CIB"
  DATA "Jacksonville.tif"
  TYPE RASTER
  STATUS ON
END
</programlisting>
</para>

<para>
Though not shown rasters can have PROJECTION, METADATA, PROCESSING, MINSCALE, 
and MAXSCALE information.  It cannot have labels, queries, CONNECTION, 
CONNECTIONTYPE, or FEATURE information.  
</para>
</sect1>

<!-- ====================================================================== -->

<sect1 id="classify">  <title>Classifying Rasters</title>

<para>
Rasters can be classified in a manner similar to vectors, with a few
exceptions.  The CLASSITEM is always the pixel value, which is indicated
by the special string "[pixel]" (must be lower case, it was "[value]" in
versions before 3.5).  The following demonstrates a raster layer with
a simple classification scheme applied to it. 
</para>


<programlisting>
LAYER
  NAME "JacksonvilleNC_CIB"
  DATA "Jacksonville.tif"
  TYPE RASTER
  STATUS ON
  CLASSITEM "[pixel]"
  CLASS
    EXPRESSION ([pixel] &lt; 64)
    COLOR 0 0 0
  END
  CLASS
    EXPRESSION ([pixel] &gt;= 64 AND [pixel] &lt; 128)
    COLOR 255 0 0 
  END
  CLASS
    EXPRESSION ([pixel] &gt;= 128 AND [pixel] &lt; 196)
    COLOR 0 255 0 
  END
  CLASS
    EXPRESSION ([pixel] &gt;= 196 AND [pixel] &lt; 256)
    COLOR 0 0 255
  END
END
</programlisting>

<para>
Some format drivers (ie. GDAL)
cast the pixel values to the range 0 to 255 <emphasis>before</emphasis>
applying the classification scheme to them, making it hard to use this
classification mechanism to classify floating point, or other data not well
expressed as unsigned byte data (0-255).  This is a bug and should be corrected
at some point in the future.  
</para>

<para>
Note that only the COLOR, EXPRESSION and NAME parameters are utilized for
raster classifications.  The other rendering information is ignored. 
</para>

</sect1>

<!-- ====================================================================== -->

<sect1 id="formats">  <title>Supported Formats</title>

<para>
What raster formats are supported by MapServer is largely controlled by
configuration time options.  Some formats are considered to be <emphasis>
built-in</emphasis> while the remainder are handled by the optional
GDAL raster library.  
</para>

<para>
More information on GDAL can be found at <ulink 
url="http://www.remotesensing.org/gdal/">http://www.remotesensing.org/gdal
</ulink>, including the <ulink url="http://www.remotesensing.org/gdal/formats_list.html">supported formats list</ulink>.  Some of the advanced MapServer
raster features, such as resampling, RGB color cube generation and automatic
projection capture only work with raster formats used through GDAL.  GDAL 
is normally built and installed separately from MapServer, and then enabled
during the build of MapServer using the <emphasis>--with-gdal</emphasis>
configuration switch.  GDAL formats not listed below include 
CEOs, DOQ, ECW, ESRI Labelled BIL, Arc/Info Binary Grid, OGDI and Erdas Imagine
(.hfa).
</para>

<para>
To find out what is built into a particular MapServer executable, use the
-v flags to discover what build options are enabled.  To find out what 
gdal formats are build, the gdal-config command may be used.  For example:
</para>

<programlisting>
warmerda@gdal[103]% ./mapserv -v
MapServer version 3.5 (pre-alpha) OUTPUT=PNG OUTPUT=JPEG OUTPUT=WBMP 
SUPPORTS=PROJ SUPPORTS=TTF INPUT=EPPL7 INPUT=OGR INPUT=GDAL INPUT=SHAPEFILE
warmerda@gdal[104]% gdal-config --formats

</programlisting>

<para>
The following formats are potential builtins.
</para>

<itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
    <para><emphasis>TIFF/GeoTIFF</emphasis>: 
      If built with <emphasis>INPUT=TIFF</emphasis> MapServer will have
      builtin support for reading TIFF or GeoTIFF files.  The builtin 
      TIFF support has some limitations with regard to the organization of
      files that can be read (no tiled, 16bit, RGB, or odd color models). 
      This driver supports 
      <ulink url="#world_files">world files</ulink>, 
      or simple builtin GeoTIFF coordinates
      for georeferencing.  The AUTO projection declaration is not support.
    </para>
    <para>
      Full featured TIFF/GeoTIFF support is available through GDAL.  Note
      that only GDAL supports tiled TIFF files and TIFF files with overviews.
      Tiled TIFF files with overviews pre-built are one of the highest 
      performance ways of serving large raster images.
    </para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para><emphasis>GIF</emphasis>: 
      If GD is configured with GIF (<emphasis>OUTPUT=GIF</emphasis>) support, 
      then MapServer will also be able
      to read GIF files for raster layers.  The only way to georeference GIF
      files is with a world file.
    </para>
    <para>
      If GD is not configured with GIF support, it may still be available in
      GDAL, which does not support georeferencing via world files.  
    </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para><emphasis>PNG</emphasis>: 
      If GD is configured with PNG (<emphasis>OUTPUT=PNG</emphasis>) support, 
      then MapServer will also be able
      to read PNG files for raster layers.  The only way to georeference PNG
      files is with a world file.
    </para>
    <para>
      If GD is not configured with PNG support, it may still be available in
      GDAL, which also supports georeferencing via world files. 
    </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para><emphasis>JPEG</emphasis>: 
      If MapServer is built with JPEG (<emphasis>INPUT=JPEG</emphasis>) 
      support then greyscale
      JPEG files may be rendered in raster layers.  RGB files (the more common 
      kind) will not be able to be displayed.  Georeferencing is via world 
      files.
    </para>
    <para>
      If MapServer is not built with native JPEG support, GDAL may still 
      support the format.  In this case RGB files are also supported (via
      the RGB color cube mechanism).  Georeferencing is still via world file.
    </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para><emphasis>Erdas .LAN/.GIS</emphasis>: 
      If configured with <emphasis>INPUT=EPPL7</emphasis> (the default) 
      MapServer will support one band eight bit Erdas LAN/GIS files.  The 
      .trl file is read for a colormap, and if not found the layer is treated 
      as greyscale.  Georeferencing is read from the file.

<sect1 id="">  <title>Rasters and Tile Indexing</title>

<para>
When handling very large raster layers it is often convenient, and higher
performance to split the raster image into a number of smaller images.  Each
file is a tile of the larger raster mosaic available for display.  The list
of files forming a layer can be stored in a shapefile with polygons 
representing the footprint of each file, and the name of the files.  This is
called a TILEINDEX and works similarly to the same feature in vector layers. 
The result can be represented in the MAP file as one layer, but MapServer 
will first scan the tile index, and ensure that only raster files overlapping
the current display request will be opened.
</para>

<para>
The following example shows a simple example.  No DATA statement is required
because MapServer will fetch the filename of the raster files from the
Location attribute column in the hp2.dbf file for records associated with
polygons in hp2.shp that intersect the current display region.  The polygons
in hp2.shp should be rectangles representing the footprint of the corresponding
file.  Note that the files do not have to be all the same size, the formats
can vary and they can even
overlap (later files will be drawn over earlier ones); however, they must all
be in the same coordinate system (projection) as the layer.
</para>

<programlisting>
  LAYER
    NAME "hpool"
    STATUS ON
    TILEINDEX "hp2.shp"
    TILEITEM "Location"
    TYPE RASTER
  END
</programlisting>

<para>
While there are many ways to produce TILEINDEX shapefiles for use with this
command, one option is the <emphasis>gdaltindex</emphasis> program, part of
the GDAL utility suite.  The gdaltindex program will automatically generate
a tile index shapefile from a list of GDAL supported raster files passed on
the command line.
</para>

<programlisting>
Usage: gdaltindex [-tileindex field_name] index_file [gdal_file]*

eg.
  % gdaltindex doq_index.shp doq/*.tif

NOTES:
  o The shapefile (index_file) will be created if it doesn't already exist.
  o The default tile index field is 'location'.
  o Raster filenames will be put in the file exactly as they are specified
    on the commandline.
  o Simple rectangular polygons are generated in the same
    coordinate system as the rasters.
</programlisting>

<para>
The gdaltindex program can be built as part of GDAL (it isn't part of the
default build), or a prebuilt copy for Windows can be downloaded from
<ulink url="ftp//gdal.velocet.ca/pub/outgoing/gdaltindex.zip">
ftp//gdal.velocet.ca/pub/outgoing/gdaltindex.zip</ulink>.  You will also need
supporting libraries <ulink 
url="ftp//ftp.remotesensing.org/gdal/gdal-1142-ntbin.zip">
ftp//ftp.remotesensing.org/gdal/gdal-1142-ntbin.zip</ulink>.
</para>

</sect1>

<!-- ====================================================================== -->

<sect1 id="warping">  <title>Raster Warping</title>

<para>
MapServer is able to resample GDAL rasters on the
fly into new projections.  Non-GDAL rasters may only be up or down
sampled without any rotation or warping.
</para>

<para>
Raster warping kicks in if the projection appears to be different for a 
raster layer than for the map being generated.  Warped raster layers are 
significantly more expensive to render than normal raster layers with 
rendering time being perhaps 2-4 times long than a normal layer.  The
projection and datum shifting transformation is computed only at selected
points, and generally linearly interpolated along the scanlines (as long as
the error appears to be less than 0.333 pixels. 
</para>

<para>
In addition to reprojecting rasters, the raster warping ability can also
apply rotation to GDAL rasters with rotational coefficients in their
georeferencing information.   Currently rotational coefficients won't 
trigger raster warping unless the map and layer have valid (though matching
is fine) projection definitions. 
</para>

</sect1>

<!-- ====================================================================== -->

<sect1 id="rgb_color_cube">  <title>24bit RGB Rendering</title>

<para>
Traditionally MapServer has been used to produce 8 bit pseudo-colored
map displays generated from 8bit greyscale or pseudocolored raster data. 
However, if the raster file to be rendered is actually 24bit (a red, 
green and blue band) then additional considerations come into play.   
Currently rendering of 24bit imagery is only supported via the GDAL 
renderer.  The built-in PNG, JPEG and other drivers do not support 24bit
input images. 
</para>

<para>
If the output is still 8bit pseudo-colored (the IMAGEMODE is PC256 in the
associated OUTPUT format declaration) then the full 24bit RGB colors for
input pixels will be converted to a color in the colormap of the output 
image.  By default a <emphasis>color cube</emphasis> is used.  That is a
fixed set of 175 colors providing 5 levels of red, 7 levels of green and
5 levels of blue is used, plus an additional 32 greyscale color entries. 
Colors in the input raster are mapped to the closest color in this color
cube on the fly.  This substantial degrades color quality, especially for
smoothly changing images.   It also fills up the colors table, limited to
256 colors, quite quickly.
</para>

<para>
A variation on this approach is to dither the image during rendering. 
Dithering selects a color for a pixel in a manner that "diffuses error"
over pixels.  In an area all one color in the source image, a variety of output
pixel colors would be selected such that the average of the pixels would more
closely approximate the desired color.  Dithering also takes advantage of all
currently allocated colors, not just those in the color cube.  Dithering 
requires GDAL 1.1.9 or later, and is enabled by providing the 
PROCESSING "DITHER=YES" option in the mapfile.   Dithering is more CPU
intensive than using a simple color cube, and should be avoided if possible
in performance sensitive situations.
</para>

<para>
The other new possibility for handling 24bit input imagery in MapServer 4.0
or later, is to produce 24bit output images.  The default "IMAGETYPE png24"
or "IMAGETYPE jpeg" declaration may be used to produce a 24bit PNG output 
file, instead of the
more common 8bit pseudo-colored PNG file.  The OUTPUTFORMAT declaration
provides for detailed control of the output format.  The IMAGEMODE RGB and
IMAGEMODE RGBA options produce 24bit and 32bit (24bit plus 8bit 
alpha/transparency) for supported formats.
</para>

<sect1 id="processing">  <title>Special Processing Directives</title>
</sect1>

<para>
In MapServer 4, the new PROCESSING keyword was added to the LAYER object.
It is primariliy used to pass specialized raster processing options to the
GDAL based raster renderer.  The following processing options are supported
in MapServer 4.
</para>

<variablelist>
    <varlistentry>

      <listitem>
	<para>This directive allows a specific band or bands to be selected from a raster file.  If one band is selected, it is treated as greyscale.  If 3 are selected, they are treated as red, green and blue.  If 4 are selected they are treated as red, green, blue and alpha (opacity).</para>
	<para>Example:
	    <screen>
PROCESSING "BANDS=4,2,1"
	    </screen>
	</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry>
      <term>SCALE[_n]=AUTO or min,max</term>
      <listitem>
	<para>This directive instructs the GDAL reader to pre-scale the 
incoming raster data.  It is primarily used to scale 16bit or floating point 
data to the range 0-255, but can also be used to constrast stretch 8bit data.  
If an explicit min/max are provided then the input data is stretch (or 
squished) such that the minimum value maps to zero, and the maximum to 255. 
If AUTO is used instead, a min/max is automatically computed.  To control the
scaling of individual input bands, use the SCALE_1, SCALE_2 and SCALE_3 
keywords (for red, green and blue) instead of SCALE which applies to all bands.
</para>

	<para>Example:
	    <screen>
PROCESSING "SCALE=AUTO"
  or
PROCESSING "SCALE_1=409,1203"
PROCESSING "SCALE_2=203,296"
PROCESSING "SCALE_3=339,1004"

      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry>
      <term>COLOR_MATCH_THRESHOLD=n</term>
      <listitem>
	<para>Alter the precision with which colors need to match an entry in 
the color table to use it when producing 8bit colormapped output (IMAGEMODE 
PC256).  Normally colors from a raster colormap (or greyscale values) need
to match exactly.  This relaxes the requirement to being within the 
specified color distance.   So a COLOR_MATCH_THRESHOLD of 3 would mean that an
existing color entry within 3 (sum of difference in red, green and blue) would
be used instead of creating a new colormap entry.  Especially with greyscale
raster layers, which would normally use all 256 color entries if available, 
this can be a good way to avoid "stealing" your whole colormap for a raster
layer.  Normally values in the range 2-6 will give good results.

<sect1 id="world_files">  <title>Georeference with World Files</title>

<para>
World files are a simple mechanism for associating georeferencing (world
coordinates) information with raster files.  ESRI was the first company to
propagate the use of world files, and they often used with TIFF instead
of embedding georeferencing information in the file itself.  
</para>

<para>
The world file contents look like the following.  The first coefficient is
the X pixel size.  The second and third are rotational/shear coefficients 
(and should normally be 0.0).  The fourth is the Y pixel size, normally 
negative indicating that Y decreases as you move down from the top left 
origin. The final two values are the X and Y location of the center of the 
top left pixel.  This example is for an image with a 2m x 2m pixel size, and 
a top left origin at (356800E, 5767999N). 
</para>

<programlisting>

356800.00
5767999.00
</programlisting>

<para>
The name of the world file is based on the file it relates to.  For instance,
the world file for aerial.tif might be aerial.tfw.  Conventions vary for
appropriate endings, but with MapServer the extension .wld is always OK
for world files.
