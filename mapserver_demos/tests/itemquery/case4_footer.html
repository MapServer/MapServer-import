and here's the map of the query results:

<img src="[img]" height="300" width="300"><br>
<center><img src="[scalebar]"></center>
</td></tr>

Note that the results are not sorted unless the shapefile had been sorted
on the county name item. You could populate JavaScript arrays and do the
sort on the result set before writing to the browser.
