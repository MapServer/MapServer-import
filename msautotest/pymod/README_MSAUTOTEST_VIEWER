msautotest viewer

The msautotest viewer is a small Web application that is provided to ease
the test results verification.  All test results that appear in the Web
page are also in the result directory of each test directory (gdal, misc
and wxs), so there are all failed tests.

To use the msautotest viewer,  you need to give Web access to the msautotest
directory.  For that edit the http_msautotest.conf and copy it to your
Apache httpd conf directory.

Edit the configuration to suit your needs.  The gdal_translate tool in 
particular, is needed to convert Geotiff image to PNG image in order to be 
able to see it in the browser.

You also need to set the path to the python executable in the 
msautotest_viewer.py python script file.
